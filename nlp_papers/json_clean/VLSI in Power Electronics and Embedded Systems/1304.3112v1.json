The role of inferencing with uncertainty is becoming more important in rule-based expert systems (ES) , since knowledge given by a human expert is often uncertain or imprecise. We have succeeded in designing a VLSI chip which can perform an entire inference process based on fuzzy logic. The design of the VLSI fuzzy inference engine emphasizes simplicity, extensibility, and efficiency (operational speed and layout area) . It is fabricated in 2.5 �m CMOS technology. The inference engine consists of three major components; a rule set memory, an inference processor, and a controller. In this implementation, a rule set memory is realized by a read only memory (ROM). The controller consists of two counters. In the inference processor, one data path is laid out for each rule. The number of the inference rule can be increased adding more data paths to the inference processor. All rules are executed in parallel, but each rule is processed serially. The logical structure of fuzzy inference proposed in the current paper maps nicely onto the VLSI structure. A two-phase nonoverlapping clocking scheme is used. Timing tests indi cate that the inference engine can operate at approximately 20.8 MHz. This translates to an execution speed of approximately 80,000 Fuzzy Logical Inferences Per Second (FLIPS), and indicates that the inference engine is suitable for a demanding real-time application. The potential applications include decision-making in the area of command and control for intelligent robot systems, process control, mi ssile and aircraft guidance, and other high performance machines. KEYWORDS: fuzzy logic, expert system, semiconductor (VLSI) 1. Introduction. One of the first expert system (ES) developments was fuzzy logic or a rule-based control system developed in 1974 by Mamdani and Assilian [1]. The system accepted human knowledge of control strategies expressed verbally, or by linguistic values, and encoded it directly as computer programs. The controlled system was a small steam engine. The verbal rules were of the form shown as follows: IF the pressure error is positive and big, and the change in pressure error is not negative medium or big THEN make the heat change negative and big. The distinguishing feature of fuzzy logic control is that it models the expert human operator instead of the process. In many practical cases, no model of the process exists because the process is too complex and ill-understood to be modelled mathematically. For such processes, a skilled human controller may be able to operate the plant successfully. The operators are often capable of expressing their operating practice in the form of rules, which may be programmed into a rule-based controller. Fuzzy control systems and expert systems have one thing in common: both want to model human experience, human decision-making behavior. Fuzzy logic has been successfully incorporated in several fuzzy control systems and expert systems [3][4][5]. Fuzzy inference is also proposed in real-time decision-making in the area of command and control [6] to select the most suitable guidance and algorithm for intercepting missiles. Selection is done by considering a constantly changing environment; that is, the relative angular positions, accelerations, and distances of an evader and a missile. These examples show the need for an efficient inference engine to handle large rule sets and for real-time use. We have designed, fabricated and tested a VLSI chip which can perform fuzzy inference (or approximate reasoning) in real-time. The chip is designed to be extensible to handle a large number of rules without slowing process speed."

The variables PB = pas it i ve and big, NM = negative and medi urn and so on are ca 11 ed fuzzy variables. Fuzzy variables are usually chosen as shown in • Figure 2. In Figure 1, a fuzzy variable A is represented by a fuzzy subset, i.e., a set of ordered pairs of an element, u i • of A and its grade of membership: ( 1) where U is a universe of discourse.  To allow statements which are characterized by fuzzy subsets. The first rule is w i n C 1 ; the second is Wt' C 2 . Then overall resulting conclusion c• is obtained by The reasoning process is illustrated in Figure 2. 0 -. ( The VLSI inf erence engine consist s of three major part s: a rule set memory, an inference processing unit , and a controller. The inference mechanism described in the previous section executes all the rules in parallel. Because of the very high rate of communication bet ween the rule set storage unit and the inference processing unit, we decided to store the rules on a chip. Otherwise, the restriction of the pin count prevents the effect ive use of the parallelism. 3.1 Storage and Format of Rule Set . The rule set can be st ored using eit her a random access memory (RAM) or a read only memory (ROM). The advant age of using RAM is its flexibilit y. Depending on the application, the rule set can be loaded from of f-chip. On the ot her hand, ROM takes much less area for the same amount of dat a and operates faster. The control unit of the inference engine can be very simple, since we do not need to load a rule set from off-chip. We considered the size of the fuzzy variables subset and the grade of fuzziness for a practical use. In most cases, a fuzzy variable has three to sixteen element s; the grade of fuzziness, three to twelve (e.g., [4,8]). For this implementation, we can limit the universe of discourse of a fuzzy subset to be a finite set wit h 32 or 64 elements (i.e., 5 or 6 bit s) . The membership function is discretized in 16 levels (i.e., 4 bit s) . That is, 0 represents no membership, 15 represent s a full membership and other numbers represent points in the unit int erval [0, 1], Therefore, a fuzzy subset can be digitized wit h 128 or 256 bits. The format of the rule represent ation is as follows: Rule 1: A; + C ; where Xl x 2 X 3 X• J X32 A;: 0010 0100 1111 J.JA. (x j ) 0000 Z1 z 2 Z3 z. J Z32 C;: 0000 0001 0011 J.J s . (z j ) 1100 Here, each 4 bits represents degree of membership for each element of the universe. For example, u 1 has a degree of membership 2/15 and u 3 has a full degree of membership in a subset A•. Each 4 bits integer is stored most significant bit first. All the rul es are accessed in parallel. An individual rule is, however, accessed in the serial manner. Two memory modules are used for storing the antecedent A•s and s •s, and the conclu sion c•s of the rule set , respect ively."

      "text": "The inference processing unit consists of two basic logical circuits for minimum and maximum operations. These circuits are used to implement fuzzy in tersection and fuzzy union operations. The circuit for minimum operation takes two integers and produces the smaller number; the circuit for maximum operation produces the larger number. These logical circuits process integers serially. The basic data path of the inference engine for processing a single rule is shown in Figure 3. This directly corresponds to a single data path of the inference engine described in Figure 2. The shift register is used for keeping the maximum after the fuzzy intersection operation in the first level. This is necessary since within an individual rule opera tions are performed serially. The register records the value of the max imum point, a value � i ' when the first level has finished its operation. The last operation of the second level requires taking the maximum membership function over all the data paths (i.e., all the rules) . This operation is accomplished by connecting the maximum units in the binary tree structure. 3.3 Controller. Because of the simplicity of the architecture, the controller of the inference engine is straightforward. It consists of two counters for accessing two memory modules serially. The controller generates a reset signal for the minimum and maximum elements for every 4 cycles. The con troller starts to access the conclusion parts of the rules as soon as the processing of the antecedent parts are finished. It also notifies a user the beginning of the valid output.   Timing tests on fabricated chips indicated a 20.8 MHz (48 ns cycle time) operating rate. With the current data format of 124 bits per rule, a single inference process takes 256 clock cycles. Thus, the engine can perform approximately 80,000 Fuzzy Logical Inference Per Second (FLIPS), which is more than 1,000 times faster than the simulation conducted on the VAX-11/785. The chip has a drastic speed advantage over the conven tional approach."

      "text": "Extensibility of the Design . The advantage of the architecture is it s sim plicity and extensibility. The format of the fuzzy variables representation can be expanded with minor changes in the layout. For example, the number of elements to represent a fuzzy variable can be either increased or decreased by minor modification of the controller. The resolution of membership function can be modified by both changing the length of the shift register and modifying the controller. The number of rules can be increased by laying out more data paths and modifying the binary tree 1 ayout accordingly."
