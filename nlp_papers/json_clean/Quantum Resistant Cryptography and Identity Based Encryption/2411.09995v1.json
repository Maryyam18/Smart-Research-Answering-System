      "text": "We are living in an era of remarkable innovation, where digital advancements are transforming our daily lives and reshaping the way we experience the world. From the cloud [1] to artificial intelligence [2], and now quantum computing [3], technological progress is accelerating at an unprecedented pace. With each breakthrough, new opportunities emerge, offering the potential to revolutionize industries, enhance the human experience, and solve complex global challenges. Quantum computing, in particular, is opening doors to the future, enabling the design of advanced AI systems in near future, the discovery of new materials [4], and the acceleration of drug discovery [5]. It is also driving new possibilities in environmental exploration, leveraging more sophisticated quantum-based sensors [6] for deeper insights. These developments represent not just the next phase of technological growth but a leap towards a more intelligent and connected future. As exciting as these advancements are, they also introduce new challenges. As we embrace these transformative technologies, we must be prepared to navigate the complexities they bring, ensuring that we harness their full potential while addressing security and ethical considerations. The emergence of fully functional quantum systems, particularly those with a few hundred error-free qubits, poses a significant threat to the integrity of modern digital cybersecurity. One of the greatest concerns is the potential collapse of current encryption methods [7], which rely on complex mathematical algorithms, especially those based on prime factorization [8]. This threat was first demonstrated in 1996 when Peter Shor introduced his quantum algorithm [9], showing that quantum computers could break cryptographic systems designed on classical mathematics, such as RSA encryption [10]. Though discussions around quantum attacks and countermeasures have been ongoing for decades, it was Shor's algorithm that underscored the urgency of addressing these vulnerabilities. His work marked a turning point, driving global awareness of the need to develop quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions to safeguard the future of digital security. As quantum technology evolves, businesses must prioritize quantum-safe encryption methods to protect against this impending cybersecurity challenge. While the progress in quantum computing is indeed impressive [11][12], it may still be some time before fully functional quantum computers are commercially available at scale. However, this doesn't mean we can afford to ignore the potential threats they pose. In fact, it's crucial to adopt an \"actnow\" approach to cybersecurity. Consider this scenario: if your sensitive data were stolen today, it might remain encrypted and seemingly safe. But years from now, when mature quantum systems become available, that same data could be decrypted, leaving you with no defence. Quantum computers have the potential to break many of today's cryptographic algorithms, putting long-term sensitive data at significant risk. Therefore, businesses must start preparing now by adopting quantum-resistant encryption methods to protect against future vulnerabilities. Proactive measures today will be essential to safeguard critical information in the quantum era. In this paper, we present a complete strategic framework for mitigating quantum attacks in industrial settings. At first part of the framework, our approach is structured into three distinct strategic levels: foundational level, intermediate level, and advanced level. These levels are designed based on the priority of implementation and the complexity of execution, providing a comprehensive pathway for organizations to strengthen their defence mechanisms against quantum threats. The next part of the framework includes a process of adoption and implementation applied to each strategic transition level. Additionally, we explore multiple potential industrial use cases aligned with each approach level, offering practical insights into their application. Furthermore, we emphasize the regulatory considerations that industries must address when implementing mitigation strategies for quantum attacks, ensuring compliance with relevant legal and policy frameworks."

      "text": "This groundbreaking technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach a wide range of fields, from solving complex optimization and artificial intelligence challenges to advancing material design and accelerating drug discovery. However, there is a darker side too which is scary to think as these advances also pose a significant threat to current cryptographic systems, as classical security relies on communication channels that could be easily compromised by a sufficiently powerful quantum computer. Quantum cryptography offers a solution to this vulnerability, as it provides a quantum-secure method of key distribution, making it nearly impossible to intercept communication channels [17]. The foundation of quantum cryptography dates back to 1970, when Stephen Wiesner [18] introduced the concept of quantum money, which inspired further research into quantum key distribution (QKD). Leveraging principles from the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) experiment [19], the field gained momentum in the 1980s and 1990s with Bennett and Brassard's landmark BB84 protocol [20] in 1984. This breakthrough demonstrated the feasibility of secure key distribution via quantum channels using photon polarization. In 1991, Artur K. Ekert [21] advanced this work with a variation of BB84, incorporating Bell states and quantum entanglement, drawing on Bell's theorem and the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequalities [22]. In 1992, the BBM92 protocol [23], an extension of BB84, was introduced and remains a foundational resource for the proposed quantum cryptographic framework. In our daily lives, we are familiar with classical mechanics, which is relatively easy to comprehend. However, quantum mechanics operates at the atomic level and exhibits some unusual phenomena. Quantum computers are built on these unique quantum mechanical properties. While classical computers use bits, where each bit is either in the state of \"0\" or \"1,\" quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in both states, \"0\" and \"1,\" simultaneously. A quantum computer basically works based on the following key essential quantum mechanical principles: Superposition: In quantum mechanics, superposition refers to a quantum state being in more than one state at the same time. Each state in superposition has a certain probability of existing, allowing quantum computers to process multiple possibilities simultaneously [24]. Entanglement: In quantum physics, entanglement occurs when two or more particles become linked in such a way that a change in one particle instantly affects the others, no matter how far apart they are. This property was used by Ekert in 1991 to develop the quantum key distribution (QKD) algorithm, Ekert91. Another entanglement-based QKD algorithm, BBM92, was proposed in 1992. The exact cause of entanglement remains an open question in physics [25]. Interference: It is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, where it occurs when quantum waves, or wavefunctions, overlap and combine. These waves represent the probabilities of different quantum states, and when they interact, they can either reinforce or cancel each other out. This phenomenon is known as constructive interference when the waves amplify each other, or destructive interference when they cancel each other out. In quantum computing, interference plays a key role in controlling qubits and optimizing quantum algorithms. By harnessing the principles of interference, quantum computers can manipulate probabilities in a way that classical computers cannot, allowing for more efficient problem-solving [26]. No-cloning theorem: This principle states that quantum states cannot be copied. Once we interact with a quantum system, its superposition collapses into a single, classical state [27]. Decoherence: Although quantum states can exist in superposition, when we measure or interact with the system, the superposition collapses, and the system settles into a single state. As a result, we cannot measure multiple quantum states at once [28]."

      "heading": "III. Strategic Planning & Adoption: Steps",
      "text": "Toward Quantum-Safe Security The quantum threat to current security systems is significant and requires an immediate \"act-now\" approach across industries. Given the complexity of existing classical security infrastructure setup, a strategic and well-planned approach is essential to address potential quantum attacks effectively. Recognizing the intricate dependencies within today's security infrastructure, we have developed a quantum-safe security framework to proactively address and mitigate future risks, ensuring organizations are prepared for the evolving threat landscape. Cryptography is generally divided into two main categories: symmetric and asymmetric cryptography: Asymmetric cryptography Asymmetric cryptography [29] relies on complex mathematical calculations, with RSA being one of the most widely used algorithms. RSA's security is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime components, a problem considered computationally intractable. While asymmetric cryptography offers strong security, it is significantly slower than symmetric methods and requires much larger keys to maintain similar levels of protection. If faster factorization techniques are developed, it would necessitate even larger prime numbers, increasing computational load and slowing down processes. Asymmetric systems use two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption, making them less efficient for widespread use in today's fast-paced digital environment, Fig 1 demonstrates the encryption and decryption in asymmetric cryptography.  From a strategic perspective, we have defined three strategic levels to guide the transition from a classical-only security approach to a quantum-safe solutioning strategy within the security landscape. These levels provide a clear, phased roadmap for organizations to gradually adopt quantum-resistant solutions while minimizing operational disruptions. By addressing immediate vulnerabilities, planning for mid-term upgrades, and preparing for long-term quantum innovations, this framework ensures a proactive and comprehensive response to emerging quantum threats. Implementing this multi-level strategy will enable businesses to future-proof their security infrastructure against the evolving technological landscape. In our strategic roadmap for adopting quantum-safe security, we introduce \"strategic transition level\" (STL) framework which outlines three key levels of defence. STL-1 (foundational level) focuses on securing systems using asymmetric cryptography in anticipation of quantum threats. STL-2 (intermediate level) and STL-3 (advanced level) address more advanced security measures, emphasizing symmetric cryptography strategies to safeguard against potential quantum attacks. This multi-tiered approach ensures comprehensive protection as the quantum landscape evolves."

      "heading": "A. Strategic Transition Level 1 (STL-1):",
      "text": "Foundation -Classical way Post-Quantum Safety Recently, NIST released first post-quantum cryptography standards [32] which enables the industry to think to \"act-now\". Over the time, researchers keep on exploring and designing new classical cryptographic algorithms that can withstand quantum attacks, noticeably are latticed based and hash-based algorithms. According to NIST recent announcement, it has standardized three cryptographic algorithms, with which post-quantum cryptography will be secure against attacks from classical and quantum computers. Currently, there isn't a large enough quantum computer that threatens the current level of security, but Moody [33] said that agencies need to be prepared ahead of future attacks. NIST has chosen CRYSTAL-Kyber [34] as the primary key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) for securing encryption processes, such as those used for public-facing websites. Additionally, three digital signature algorithms-CRYSTAL-Dilithium [35], FALCON [36], and SPHINCS+ [37]-have been selected for standardization (Fig 3). CRYSTAL-Dilithium, FALCON, and SPHINCS+ will be employed in situations where digital signatures are required to ensure authentication and integrity. These selections represent the industry's move toward quantum-resistant cryptographic standards to protect sensitive data in the evolving digital landscape. We strongly recommend adopting the STL-1 approach as the immediate priority to secure sensitive data. This approach is highly cost-effective and straightforward to implement, offering a quicker and smoother transition compared to the more complex STL-2 and STL-3 strategies. It requires minimal changes to the existing infrastructure and has a negligible impact on the current cryptographic systems, making it an ideal starting point for organizations looking to enhance their security without significant disruption. By addressing immediate vulnerabilities while maintaining operational efficiency, the STL-1 approach provides a solid foundation for future security enhancements. Intermediate -Quantum Enhanced Approach At present, we do not have sufficiently mature quantum systems to fully test the STL-1 security strategy. In STL-1, we discussed using advanced classical algorithms based on solid mathematical theories to mitigate future quantum attacks. However, this approach may not offer complete protection, as more advanced quantum techniques could potentially breach the STL-1 defences in the future. To ensure long-term security, we recommend transitioning to the STL-2 strategy after implementing STL-1. The STL-2 strategy emphasizes a hybrid quantumclassical approach, where Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) [38] play a critical role. QRNGs leverage quantum mechanics to produce truly random numbers, unlike classical random number generators that depend on deterministic algorithms or physical processes. By incorporating QRNG-generated keys with classical cryptographic algorithms (such as \"Advanced Encryption Standard\" as an example [39]), the STL-2 strategy offers a more robust defence against postquantum attacks. This hybrid approach significantly enhances security, providing better resistance to potential future quantum threats compared to the STL-1 strategy. Additionally, it allows businesses to gradually integrate quantum technologies while maintaining the effectiveness of their current systems. While it's important to account for the costs associated with implementing QRNG devices-including hardware expenses, training, and ongoing maintenance, etc.-these investments are higher compared to the STL-1 strategy. However, the increased cost is justified by the significantly enhanced security that QRNGs provide. Given the potential risk of future quantum-based security breaches, the investment in QRNG technology is a proactive measure that can safeguard critical assets and reduce the likelihood of costly security vulnerabilities. In the long run, the value of preventing quantum attacks far outweighs the upfront and operational expenses, making it a strategic and necessary investment for businesses focused on long-term cybersecurity resilience."

      "text": "-Quantum Only Approach Although, in a quantum-classical hybrid approach, QRNG provides enhanced level of security for quantum attacks but it is still not safe enough as the classical part in this hybrid approach is still vulnerable. So, we need a pure quantum solutioning approach, so recommending the next level of strategy to adopt is STL-3 where we emphasis on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) [40], which is widely regarded as the most practical solution to mitigate quantum attacks, relying on the principles of quantum physics rather than complex mathematical algorithms. Often synonymous with quantum cryptography, QKD can be viewed as an advanced extension of symmetric cryptography, incorporating the foundational elements of quantum mechanics, Fig 4 shows the QKD mechanism. By leveraging quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement, QKD ensures secure key exchange, making it highly effective in safeguarding sensitive data during transmission. This approach offers a robust defence against both current and future quantum threats, providing unparalleled security assurance. The STL-3 strategy involves a complex adoption process and significant infrastructure transition costs. A thorough feasibility analysis is essential to identify system gaps and prioritize the transition from classical to quantum solutions effectively. Rigorous planning is crucial to ensure a smooth and cost-efficient transition and implementation.  The following Table 1 shares some of our proposed important parameters which helps in determining the feasible strategic level we should focus on to consider.

Strategic Roadmap for Quantum-Resilient Industrial Applications Quantum attacks present significant challenges across industries, but the greater hurdle lies in deploying a well-structured framework that strategically integrates quantum-resistant solutions into existing classical cryptographic infrastructures. To address this, we introduce our second novel and comprehensive strategic framework, \"QCRYPTO\", designed to enable seamless quantum infusion into (or transformation from) current cryptographic systems. The proposed QCRYPTO framework provides a methodical, industry-focused roadmap to help organizations transition from classical cryptographic methods to quantum-resilient solutions. Its high-impact methodology ensures that industries across sectors, including finance, healthcare, and critical infrastructure, are equipped to anticipate and mitigate quantum threats. By STL 3 STL 2 STL 1 aligning with industry-specific requirements, our strategic QCRYPTO framework facilitates a smooth, phased adoption of quantum technologies, optimizing operational security while maintaining compliance with emerging global standards. This approach is critical as industries face the pressing need for quantum preparedness, ensuring that cybersecurity measures remain robust in the face of future quantum advancements."

Quantum communication protocols, especially over Fiber optics, need specialized equipment such as quantum repeaters [47] and low-noise detectors to support long-distance communication. For instance, researchers have demonstrated the use of twin-field QKD over distances of up to 1000 km using Fiber optics [42]. b) Security Module Integration The ISO has introduced standards that address the secure integration of QKD modules into conventional network systems. This is particularly important to ensure that QKD systems are protected from conventional network threats, such as denialof-service attacks. These standards align QKD with cryptographic module testing and certification, thus promoting secure and standardized deployment [41]. c) Quantum Repeater Technology Quantum repeaters are a critical piece of hardware required for extending the range of QKD beyond current Fiber distance limitations. Recent advancements have shown that quantum repeaters are essential for overcoming the distance limitations in Fiber-based QKD and are expected to become central to the widespread deployment of quantum communication systems [42] [47]. d) Satellite-Based QKD Satellite-based QKD has emerged as a viable solution for extending secure communication to global scales. Researchers have successfully demonstrated satellite-to-ground QKD, which enables secure key exchanges over long distances without the need for Fiber optics [42]."
