      "text": "broadcast an e-mail to the employees of the company independently. Once an employee receives several ciphertexts from different managers, an issue of message authentication will arise. In such case confidentiality and authenticity required simultaneously. Motivated by this Duan and Cao [10] gave the first multi-receiver identity based signcryption scheme. Later on some more multi-receiver identity based signcryption schemes were proposed [12,17,19,21]. In this paper, we propose an identity based multi-signcryption scheme which is more efficient then the schemes S. Deva et. al [18] and Zhang et. al [23]. Our scheme needs no pairing computation on the signcryption stage. The scheme also possesses public verifiability for signature. We also convert our proposed scheme for multiple receivers, which we believe is the first multi-signcryption scheme for multiple receivers."

Remarks: (i) In the proposed schemes, we use the concept of Duan and Cao [10] which they proposed to construct an Identity based Multi-receiver signcryption scheme. (ii) One of the important advantages of the proposed scheme is that no pairing computation is needed for signcryption. This makes the scheme quite efficient. (iii) To achieve efficiency in Zhang et al. scheme [23], only one signer will compute the signcryptext but in our scheme every user can generates own copy of signcryptext. (iv) The proposed scheme is publicly verifiable. Any one who can access to the signcryptext can verify the signature on ciphertext c . Thus the proposed scheme is more applicable when signing a joint confidential contract between two or more organizations. Any one can verify the authenticity of the contract without getting any knowledge of it, however, only the authority can read the contract."
