  "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) has enhanced the performance of various downstream tasks in visual-language understanding. Most existing approaches encode images and videos into separate feature spaces, which are then fed as inputs to large language models. However, due to the lack of unified tokenization for images and videos, namely misalignment before projection, it becomes challenging for a Large Language Model (LLM) to learn multi-modal interactions from several poor projection layers. In this work, we unify visual representation into the language feature space to advance the foundational LLM towards a unified LVLM. As a result, we establish a simple but robust LVLM baseline, Video-LLaVA, which learns from a mixed dataset of images and videos, mutually enhancing each other. As a result, Video-LLaVA outperforms Video-ChatGPT by 5.8%, 9.9%, 18.6%, and 10.1% on MSRVTT, MSVD, TGIF, and ActivityNet, respectively. Additionally, our Video-LLaVA also achieves superior performances on a broad range of 9 image benchmarks. Notably, extensive experiments demonstrate that Video-LLaVA mutually benefits images and videos within a unified visual representation, outperforming models designed specifically for images or videos. We aim for this work to provide modest insights into the multi-modal inputs for the LLM.",

      "text": "Recently, LLMs have gained rapid popularity in the AI community, such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), PaLM (Bi et al., 2020;Anil et al., 2023), andBLOOM (Scao et al., 2022). They rely on their powerful language comprehension abilities to follow human-provided instructions and provide corresponding responses. Typically, LLMs can only respond within the text input provided by the user, which is insufficient because human interaction with the world involves multiple channels, such as visual and textual. To this end, recent Video-LLaVA aligns images and videos before projection, allowing LLM to learn from a unified visual representation and endowing LLM with the ability to comprehend both images and videos simultaneously. works (Ye et al., 2023;Zhu et al., 2023b;Alayrac et al., 2022) have mapped images into text-like tokens, enabling LLMs to emerge with the ability to comprehend images. Despite their effectiveness, empowering LLMs to understand videos is more challenging than image-only comprehension tasks. Nevertheless, recent work (Maaz et al., 2023;Li et al., 2023c;Zhang et al., 2023a) has made initial strides in enabling interactions between video and language. However, most current LVLMs (Li et al., 2023b;Dai et al., 2023;Luo et al., 2023;Li et al., 2023a;Yin et al., 2023;Fu et al., 2023) can primarily handle a single visual modality, either imagelanguage or video-language. We compare different LVLM paradigms as shown in Figure 1, where VideoChat (Li et al., 2023c) and Video-LLaMA (Zhang et al., 2023a) utilize a share visual encoder to handle both images and videos. However, due to the inherent differences in the media types of images and videos, it is challenging to learn a unified representation, and the performance falls significantly behind that of the specialized video expert model, Video-ChatGPT. Therefore, X-LLM (Chen et al., 2023) and Macaw-LLM (Lyu et al., 2023) allocate a modality-specific encoder for each modality, attempting to enable a LLM to comprehend images or videos through several projection layers. But their performances are inferior to dedicated video expert models such as Video-ChatGPT (Maaz et al., 2023). We attribute this phenomenon to the lack of alignment before projection. Because image features and video features reside in their own spaces, this poses a challenge for a LLM to learn their interactions from several poor projection layers. Some similar phenomenon such as alignment before fusion has been discussed by ALBEF (Li et al., 2021) and ViLT (Kim et al., 2021) in multi-model models. More recently, ImageBind-LLM (Han et al., 2023) focuses on enabling the LLM to simultaneously process multiple modal inputs by pre-aligning each modality to a common feature space (Girdhar et al., 2023). Based on a large image-language model, ImageBind-LLM converts other modalities into the most similar image features by retrieving from a training-free image cached database. However, the indirect alignment approach of ImageBind-LLM may lead to performance degradation, and the LLM has no knowledge of actual video data. In this work, we introduce Video-LLaVA, a simple but powerful baseline for the LVLM simultaneously handling both images and videos. Specifically, As shown in Figure 1, Video-LLaVA initially aligns the representations of images and videos to a unified visual feature space. Since the visual representations are already aligned prior to projection, we employ a shared projection layer to map the unified visual representation for the LLM. To enhance computational efficiency, Video-LLaVA undergoes joint training of images and videos, achieving remarkable results with 1 training epoch. As a result, The proposed Video-LLaVA greatly enhances the ability of the LLM to simultaneously understand both images and videos. For image understanding, Video-LLaVA surpasses advanced LVLMs such as mPLUG-owl-7B and InstructBLIP-7B in 5 image benchmarks. Additionally, utilizing 4 benchmark toolkits for a more comprehensive evaluation, Video-LLaVA-7B even outperforms IDEFICS-80B by 6.4% in MMBench. Moreover, similar trends can be observed in video understanding, where Video-LLaVA surpasses Video-ChatGPT by 5.8%, 9.9%, 18.6%, and 10.1% respectively on the MSVD, MSRVTT, TGIF, and ActivityNet video question-answering datasets. Ex-tensive ablation experiments demonstrate that alignment before projection yields greater benefits. Additionally, joint training of images and videos can facilitate a unified visual representation in LLM comprehension. We summarize our primary contributions as follows: • We introduce Video-LLaVA, a powerful LVLM baseline. During the training process, Video-LLaVA binds visual signals to the language feature space, unifying visual representations, and proposes a solution to align before projection. We enable an LLM to perform visual reasoning capabilities on both images and videos simultaneously. • Extensive experiments demonstrate that a unified visual representation benefits LLMs in le"

These include LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023), Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), and more recently, LLaMA 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b). These models are tuned with instruction sets to emulate conversations between humans and AI assistants. Furthermore, InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) is trained based on GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) with 175 billion parameters through aligning with human preferences. However, LLMs can only interact within text.

      "heading": "LLMs as decoder",
      "text": "Regarding the approach of treating LLM as a decoder, this is our primary focus. MiniGPT-4 (Zhu et al., 2023b) aligns image tokens to the input of the large language model through several linear projection layers. However, this alignment is weak and lacks feedback from human instructions. Subsequently, mPLUG-Owl (Ye et al., 2023) adopts a two-stage training approach. In the first stage, images are aligned with language using an autoregressive pretraining style, and the second stage involves instruction tuning through using a human instruction dataset. With the increasing scale of large language model backends, approaches such as InstructBLIP (Dai et al., 2023) and LLaVA series (Liu et al., 2023b,a;Lin et al., 2024) collecte the larger human instruction datasets to train a larger LVLMs (13B parameters). Each answer of instruction datasets strictly follow to the given instructions. Then they undergo end-to-end training using human instruction datasets, enabling the LLM with visual reasoning capabilities. Moreover, Video-ChatGPT (Maaz et al., 2023) design a 100k video instruction dataset, successfully empowering LLMs to comprehend videos. VideoChat (Li et al., 2023c) and Video-LLaMA (Zhang et al., 2023a) achieve this by conducting joint training, allowing LLMs to simultaneously handle images and videos. Expanding LLMs to additional visual modalities typically requires pre-alignment, as seen in LLaMA-Adapter (Zhang et al., 2023b;Gao et al., 2023) and ImageBind-LLM (Han et al., 2023). They bind other modalities to the image space through ImageBind's (Girdhar et al., 2023) modality encoder. These models have demonstrated that a unified feature space is advantageous for enhancing LLM's multi-modal reasoning capabilities. Distinguished from prior work, Video-LLaVA not only pre-aligns image and video features but also conducts joint training of images and videos, facilitating LLMs in learning multi-modal reasoning capabilities from a unified visual representation. 3 Video-LLaVA 3.1 Model Structure 3.1.1 Framework Overview As shown in Figure 2, Video-LLaVA consists of LanguageBind encoders f V (Zhu et al., 2023a) to extract features from the raw visual signal (im-ages or videos), a large language model f L such as Vicuna, visual projection layers f P and a word embedding layer f T . We initially obtain visual features using LanguageBind encoders. Language-Bind encoders are capable of mapping different modalities into the textual feature space, thereby providing us with a unified visual representation. Subsequently, the unified visual representation is encoded by shared projection layers, which is then combined with tokenized textual queries and fed into a large language model to generate corresponding responses."

We assume that the same information can be conveyed through multiple media. For example, a running dog can be expressed through language, a image or a video simultaneously. Therefore, we can compress information from different modalities into a common feature space, allowing the model to extract information from a dense feature space, facilitating modality interactions and complementarity. Hence, we chose the modality encoders from Lan-guageBind (Zhu et al., 2023a), which align images and videos with the textual feature space."

Subsequently, it aligns video representations to the language space using 3 million video-text pairs from VIDAL-10M (Zhu et al., 2023a). By sharing a language feature space, the image and video representations ultimately converge into a unified visual feature space, which we refer to as emergent alignment of images and videos. Therefore, our video encoder and image encoder are initialized from the LanguageBind encoders zoo, pre-aligning the inputs for LLM and reducing the gap between representations of different visual signals. The unified visual representation is fed into LLM after passing through a shared projection layer."

Additionally, since MAE do not interact with multi-modal inputs during the training process, we utilize CLIP-L/14, a model of the same size. While CLIP-L/14 exhibits strong multimodal understanding capabilities, it is not prealigned with the video encoder. Consequently, this results in a lack of uniformity in the visual features provided to LLM. We only replace the image encoder of the same scale and keep the LanguageBind video encoder."
