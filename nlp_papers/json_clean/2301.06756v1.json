      "text": "Helium, the second most abundant element in the universe, exhibits an extremely large electronic band gap of about 20 eV at low pressures (≤ 0.1 GPa). While the metallization pressure of hcp helium has been accurately predicted, thus far little attention has been paid to the specific mechanisms driving the band-gap closure and electronic properties of this quantum crystal in the terapascal regime (1 TPa = 1, 000 GPa). Here, we employ state-of-the-art density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory calculations to fill up this knowledge gap. It is found that prior to reaching metallicity bulk solid helium becomes an excitonic insulator (EI), an exotic state of matter typically observed in low-dimensional systems in which electrostatically bound electron-hole pairs form spontaneously. Furthermore, it is shown that electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is significantly enhanced across the EI to metal phase transition as signaled by prominent phonon softening and giant EPC strength values (λ ∼ 10-100) estimated at specific reciprocal space points. Accordingly, we predict metallic helium to be a superconductor with a critical temperature of ≈ 30 K at 20 TPa and of ≈ 100 K at 100 TPa. These unforeseen phenomena have important consequences on the elastic, thermodynamic and transport properties of metallic helium hence may be critical for improving our fundamental understanding and modelling of celestial bodies. In their final evolution stage, most stars in the Universe become white dwarfs (WDs) consisting of a mixture of helium, carbon, and oxygen atoms immersed in a sea of electrons. In small-radius WDs, fusion reactions beyond helium hardly occur hence their chemical composition is practically monoelemental. In the interior of WDs, pressure may reach values billions of times higher than that in the Earth's surface (∼ 10,000 GPa = 10 TPa), which currently are not accessible in experiments. Thus, theoretical modelling of light materials under extreme compression conditions, and in particular of helium, turns out to be critical for probing the interior of WDs and comprehend their physico-chemical evolution. Highly accurate diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations predict solid helium to become a metal in the hexagonal closed packed (hcp) phase at a pressure of 25.7 TPa [1]. By considering zero-point energy and * Corresponding author: claudio.cazorla@upc.edu electron-phonon coupling effects estimated with density functional theory (DFT) methods, such a metallization pressure increases up to 32.9 TPa at T = 0 K [2]. Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that the valence-band maximum (VBM) of 4 He appears on the line joining the reciprocal lattice points Γ (0, 0, 0) and M (q, 0, 0), while the conduction-band minimum (CBM) is located at the Γ point [2,3]. Thus, the band gap of solid helium is indirect and according to previous DFT calculations the overlap between the conduction and valence bands when approaching metallization is characteristic of a semimetal (i.e., the density of electronic states at the Fermi level is negligible) [2]. Meanwhile, the lattice phonons involving atomic displacements perpendicular to the hcp basal plane strongly couple to the electronic bands and at very high pressure these drive the widening of the band gap [2]. A detailed understanding of the electronic band structure properties of this archetypal quantum crystal [4], however, is still lacking. First, about half a century ago the existence of an exotic insulating phase called \"excitonic insulator\" (EI) was predicted in which electrons and holes spontaneously form bound pairs called excitons [5]. The EI phase could be stabilized at sufficiently low temperatures in semiconductors with tinny band gaps or semimetals with very small band overlaps. Recently, experimental EI fingerprints have been reported for lowdimensional transition metal dichalcogenide structures exhibiting small band gaps [6,7]; however, stabilization of a bulk EI state remains elusive. Owing to its semiconductor nature, absence of structural transformations and marked quantum character, ultra-compressed 4 He appears to be an excellent candidate in which a bulk EI state could emerge and genuine quantum manybody phenomena like high-temperature excitonic superconductivity and BEC-BCS crossover might occur [8,9]. Is possibly solid helium a bulk EI in the TPa regime? And second, the substantial electron-phonon coupling and semimetal Fermi surface previously disclosed in solid helium suggest the possibility of superconductivity in this quantum crystal upon band-gap closure. Is metallic helium a superconductor? If so, what are the underlying physical mechanisms and corresponding critical temperature? Besides their fundamental interest, answering to these questions may have major consequences in the fields of planetary science and astrophysics since this new knowledge could improve our understanding of the thermal and chemical evolution of small-radius WDs [10"

      "text": "First-principles calculations outline. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [25]. The projector augmented-wave (PAW) method [26] was employed and the 1s 2 electrons in the He atoms were treated as valence. Different families of DFT functionals were tested among which we highlight the semi-local Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [27] and revised PBE for solids (PBEsol) [28], van der Waals corrected DFT-D3 [29], non-local dispersion corrected vdW-optB88 [30], vdW-DF-cx [31], rev-vdW-DF2 [32], and the hybrid HSE06 [33], B3LYP [34] and HSEsol [35]. A plane wave energy cutoff of 1500 eV was employed along with dense Monkhorst-Pack k-point sampling grids of resolution 2π×0.025 Å (Fig. S11). The energy and atomic forces in the structural relaxations were converged to within 10 -6 eV and 0.002 eV/ Å, respectively. For validation purposes, we compared our band gap results obtained with the PBE functional as implemented in the VASP code with a full-potential (linearized) augmented planewave method as implemented in the WIEN2k code [36] (Fig. S12). Phonon calculations were performed with the small displacement method and the PHONOPY code [37] by employing large supercells of 4 × 4 × 4. The binding energy of an exciton was estimated with the Wannier-Mott formula: where m u = (m e •m h )/(m e +m h ). In the equation above, m e and m h are the effective mass of the electron at the bottom of the conduction band and the hole at the top of the valence band, respectively. Ry represents the Rydberg constant (= 13.6 eV), m 0 the rest mass of the electron, and r the dielectric constant of the system as referred to vacuum. The electron and hole effective masses were computed like the inverse of the second derivative of the conduction and valence band energies with respect to crystal momentum module, |k|, along the reciprocal space path Λ-Γ. The Wannier-Mott formula is a good approximation for the exciton binding energy of materials possessing high dielectric constants [16], which is the case of hcp 4 He in the TPa regime (Fig. S3). The elastic tensor was determined at zero temperature by performing six finite lattice distortions and four atomic displacements of 0.01 Å along each Cartesian direction. The adiabatic bulk modulus, K, and shear modulus, G, were obtained by computing the Voigt-Reuss-Hill averages from the elastic tensor. The longitudinal and transverse sound velocities were calculated with the formulas v p = (K + 4  3 G)/ρ 1/2 and v s = [G/ρ] 1/2 , respectively, where ρ represents the atomic density of the system. Crystal structure prediction analysis. The ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) package [12,13] was used to perform crystal structure searches for solid 4 He. The first-principles DFT code CASTEP [38] was employed to perform the underlying electronic structure calculations based on the PBE functional [27]. The searches were performed at 100 TPa, producing approximately 1000 relaxed structures and considering a total of 12 atoms in the simulation cell. The energy cutoff was set to 1000 eV and a specially designed hard OTFG potential was employed for the calculations. Under these conditions, it was found that the hexagonal P 6 3 /mmc (hcp) phase remained the ground state followed by a rhombohedral R3m phase with a higher relative energy of 0.131 eV/atom. Other energetically competitive structures were an hexagonal P 6m 2 (0.140 eV/atom) and a cubic Im3m (0.170 eV/atom) phase. SSCHA calculations. Quantum anharmonic effects were assessed with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) method [20][21][22][23]. All the SSCHA calculations were evaluated at the pressure of 35 TPa and 0 K, conditions at which excellent convergence of the SSCHA minimization has been verified by an extra population including 800 supercell configurations. SSCHA calculations were performed with a 6×6×3 supercell including 216 atoms, which yields the dynamical matrices on a commensurate q-mesh of 6×6×3. The trial harmonic dynamical matrices used for initializing the free energy were obtained from the DFPT method as implemented in the Quantum Espresso (QE) code in the corresponding commensurate q-mesh. In the self-consistent calculations of the supercells, we used the same cutoff energy as the electron-phonon coupling calculations for the primitive cell, but the k-mesh was reduced accordingly and was tested for convergence. In the SSCHA iterations, except the first four populations in which only internal coordinates were optimized to speed up the minimization, the free energy in other populations was minimized with respect to all degrees of freedom of the crystal structure including the internal coordinates and the lattice cell parameters. Many-body perturbation theory calculations. The excitonic binding energy was also estimated by means of highly accurate many-body perturbation theory calculations [39] performed with the Yambo code [40]. For "
