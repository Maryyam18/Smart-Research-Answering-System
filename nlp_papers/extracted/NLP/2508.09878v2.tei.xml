<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>As interest grows in applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to mental health, an expanding body of work explores the automatic detection and classification of cognitive distortions (CDs). CDs are habitual patterns of negatively biased or flawed thinking that distort how people perceive events, judge themselves, and react to the world. Identifying and addressing them is a central goal of therapy. Despite this momentum, the field remains fragmented, with inconsistencies in CD taxonomies, task formulations, and evaluation practices limiting comparability across studies. This survey presents the first comprehensive review of 38 studies spanning two decades, mapping how CDs have been implemented in computational research and evaluating the methods applied. We provide a consolidated CD taxonomy reference, summarise common task setups, and highlight persistent challenges to support more coherent and reproducible research. Alongside our review, we introduce practical resources, including curated evaluation metrics from surveyed papers, a standardised datasheet template, and an ethics flowchart, available online. 1</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Cognitive distortions (CDs) are habitual patterns of negatively biased or logically flawed thinking that distort how people perceive events, judge themselves, and react to the world around them. These distortions play a central role in emotional distress and are a core target of evidence-based psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Beck, 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Burns, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Common examples<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> include Catastrophising ('I let them down, so they'll never trust me again'), Mind Reading ('They haven't replied, so they must be angry at me'), and All or Nothing Thinking ('If I don't get this right the first time, I'm a complete failure'). These patterns often appear intuitive or harmless at first, but they have been shown to maintain and exacerbate conditions like depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In therapeutic settings, recognising and reframing such distortions is a core goal of CBT. Crucially, these distortions are primarily expressed through language, making them well-suited to computational modelling. Recent work in natural language processing (NLP) has begun to explore the automatic detection and classification of CDs, with applications ranging from clinical decision support tools to mental health chatbots, journaling tools, and triage systems. Studies have shown that incorporating CD-level features can improve outcomes in related tasks such as depression detection <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2023b)</ref>, complementing more traditional sentiment or topic based approaches. By identifying distorted cognitive patterns in everyday text, NLP systems may support more timely, personalised, and psychologically-informed interventions.</p><p>Despite rapid growth in the field, the literature remains fragmented. Computational approaches use inconsistent taxonomies for defining CDs, making it difficult to compare findings across studies. Task formulations (e.g., detection vs classification, single-label vs multi-label) vary widely, often reflecting implicit assumptions that shape evaluation and outcomes. Benchmarks are scarce, metrics inconsistently applied, and variations in domain and dataset usage further complicate comparisons, making it hard to pinpoint gaps or establish best practices.</p><p>To our knowledge, the most comparable prior survey is by <ref type="bibr">Suputra et al. (2023)</ref>, which examined 12 studies and provided an initial synthesis of modelling approaches used at the time.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Used in experiments</head><p>Inherited taxonomy from dataset usage Mentioned conceptually only cluding recent preprints, and offering a structured overview of the computational landscape for CD detection and classification. This survey aims to provide a clear and practical entry point for researchers engaged in the growing field of CD detection and classification from a computational perspective. Our focus is firmly on how computational methods approach these tasks, without seeking to redefine or adjudicate psychological constructs themselves. The contributions in this paper are threefold. (i) It provides a consolidated reference of the CD taxonomies used across computational studies, highlighting inconsistencies and listing common synonyms (Tables <ref type="table">1</ref> and <ref type="table">3</ref>). (ii) It defines and analyses task setups, datasets, computational methods, and approaches to performance evaluation, highlighting key patterns and gaps ( §2, §4, §5, §6</p><p>). (iii) It identifies open challenges ( §7) and proposes best practices to guide future research ( §8). In doing so, this paper aims to enable more consistent, comparable, and reproducible work in this emerging field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Task Definitions</head><p>At its core, computational work on CDs involves a basic classification task: determining whether a given text reflects distorted thinking, and if so, identifying the specific type(s) of distortion. However, a number of different versions of this definition have been adopted in distinct groups of studies, inhibiting direct comparison between them. Some publications combine the classification task with additional tasks that may or may not inform classification. This section reviews how existing research defines CD tasks, highlights key differences, and links these to their clinical foundations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Binary Classification (Detection)</head><p>The simplest way to frame the computational task is to ask whether a given text span contains any instance of distorted thinking. This is often called detection and is usually treated as a binary classification problem (Distorted vs Undistorted). Methodologically, detection is a basic case of classification with just two labels -the approach remains the same, only the label set is coarser. This binary framing reflects early clinical aims, where simply noticing the presence of distorted thinking is an important first step before exploring the person's thoughts in more detail during therapy. Even so, most computational studies go further, aiming to identify specific CD types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Single-label vs Multi-label Classification</head><p>While detection addresses the presence of distorted thinking, classification aims to specify which type(s) of CD are present in a given text. Here, task definitions diverge based on assumptions around label cardinality:</p><p>Single-label classification. This assumes that each text span reflects exactly one type of distortion. This simplifying assumption is often motivated by practical constraints, such as dataset design or the brevity of inputs (e.g., tweets, short user queries). However, it neglects the fact that distorted thoughts frequently exhibit multiple overlapping CD categories, particularly in longer or more detailed texts.</p><p>Multi-label classification. This allows a text to be assigned multiple CD categories simultaneously. This formulation more accurately reflects clinical reality, where distortions co-occur and interact. Studies adopting multi-label setups typically model each CD type as an independent binary label, which simplifies analysis and inter-annotator agreement calculations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lybarger et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Tauscher et al., 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Auxiliary Tasks</head><p>Beyond isolated classification, some studies incorporate auxiliary tasks that extend the utility or interpretability of CD models. These are not necessarily distinct problem categories, but rather downstream or complementary tasks that build upon classification outputs:</p><p>Reasoning generation. This involves producing explanatory rationales for why a particular text span was classified as distorted. Methods such as Diagnosis of Thought (DoT) prompting <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen et al., 2023)</ref> and the later ERD (Extraction, Reasoning, Debate) framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lim et al., 2024)</ref> aim to mimic clinician-like reasoning, improving model transparency and trustworthiness.</p><p>Reframing generation. This focuses on producing healthier rephrasings of distorted thoughts, consistent with CBT interventions. Studies in this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Sharma et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Maddela et al., 2023)</ref> treat reframing as a natural extension of detection and classification.</p><p>Multi-task learning. These setups combine CD classification with related objectives, such as depression severity prediction <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2023a)</ref> or emotion cause extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Singh et al., 2023)</ref>. These formulations tend to leverage the diagnostic value of CD features to improve performance on auxiliary tasks.</p><p>Multi-modal approaches.</p><p>While the vast majority of computational CD research focuses on textual data, recent work has begun to explore multi-modal approaches. For example, Singh et al. (2023) integrated text, audio, and video inputs from therapist-patient interactions to enhance CD detection. Though still nascent, these efforts highlight the potential of multi-modal signals in capturing the subtle nuances of distorted thinking in real-world settings. 3 Taxonomies of CDs in NLP Despite the shared objective of classifying CDs, studies seeking to label CDs have adopted diverse taxonomies. Without standardisation, it is hard to keep annotations consistent, compare models properly, or clearly interpret the results. Table 1 illustrates this fragmentation by mapping which CD categories are recognised across the papers surveyed. While some categories, such as Labelling and Should Statements, are commonly used, others are inconsistently applied or redefined in various ways. Early conceptions of CDs were proposed by Beck (1963), who described patterns of dysfunctional thinking with examples such as arbitrary inference and overgeneralisation. This work was later popularised by Burns (1999), whose ten-category taxonomy is frequently cited in psychology literature. 3 However, computational studies do not uniformly follow this framework. Some papers, such as Shickel et al. (2020), draw on definitions from popular psychology sources (e.g., PsychCentral, Psychology Today), resulting in the inclusion of broader or differently framed categories. Other works make subtle assumptions in how the Burns taxonomy is applied, for example, by splitting Jumping to Conclusions into its subcategories Mind Reading and Fortune Telling, sometimes without explicit rationale. Terminology also varies across studies. The CD category referred to as All or Nothing Thinking also frequently appears under alternative labels such as Black and White Thinking, Polarised Thinking, or Dichotomous Reasoning. This terminological variety complicates efforts to harmonise and compare datasets. Since Rojas-Barahona et al. (2018) noted that CDs were 'fairly well standardised' in computational research, the field has grown considerably -from a handful of studies to 38 now in this survey -leading to a surge in differing taxonomies. The aim of Table 1 is to offer a consolidated view of this evolving landscape, providing a resource for future NLP research. Additionally, we include an appendix table (Table 3) listing synonyms, definitions, and hierarchical relationships between CD types, to support more consistent and transparent classification efforts in computational contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Datasets</head><p>Datasets are the foundation for research on CD classification, providing the labelled examples needed to develop and evaluate detection methods. However, existing datasets vary widely in scope, annotation practices, and accessibility. To organise this diversity, we group datasets by their underlying data sources and contexts of use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Domains</head><p>We use the term domain to describe the broader context from which a dataset's text data originates. Domains shape the linguistic style of examples, affect annotation reliability, and carry practical considerations such as data privacy and availability. The following six domains reflect the main sources of data in current CD classification research.</p><p>Literature Examples. Early work, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wiemer-Hastings et al. (2004)</ref>, used CD examples from existing psychological literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Beck, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Burns, 1999)</ref>. While these examples are clear and well-labelled, they are typically idealised and explicit, limiting their applicability to real-world, patient-generated language.</p><p>Social Media Platforms. Public posts from platforms such as Reddit <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aureus et al., 2021)</ref>, Twitter <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alhaj et al., 2022)</ref>, and Weibo <ref type="bibr">(Qi et al., 2024)</ref> provide naturally occurring CD instances in usergenerated content. This domain offers large volumes of data but poses challenges related to linguistic noise and context ambiguity.</p><p>Digital Mental Health Platforms. Peer-support services, such as Koko <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Rojas-Barahona et al., 2018)</ref> and TaoConnect <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Shickel et al., 2020)</ref>, have been valuable sources of data rich in CDs. The widely used THERAPISTQA dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Shreevastava and Foltz, 2021)</ref> originates from a Kaggle Q&amp;A repository and has since been extended in multiple studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Babacan et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lalk et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Crowd-Sourced Approaches. To tackle issues of data scarcity and privacy, several studies have turned to crowdworkers to generate or annotate CD examples. Well-known corpora created this way include CROWDDIST <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Shickel et al., 2020)</ref>, PATTERNREFRAME <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Maddela et al., 2023)</ref>, and THINKING TRAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Sharma et al., 2023)</ref>. These datasets are scalable and flexible but often lack the subtlety of real-world data, as crowdworkers may produce overly explicit examples.</p><p>Clinical Interventions. These datasets, derived from real therapeutic conversations, reflect how people communicate in real-world settings. Notable examples include annotated patient-therapist text message exchanges <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lybarger et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Tauscher et al., 2023)</ref> and psychotherapy transcripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Lalk et al., 2024)</ref>. Multimodal corpora such as <ref type="bibr">CODEC and</ref><ref type="bibr">CODER (Singh et al., 2023, 2024</ref>) also fall into this category, although they involve a mix of authentic and staged interactions. Despite their value, these datasets are often subject to access restrictions due to privacy and ethical considerations.</p><p>Synthetic Datasets Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic CD data. Babacan et al. ( <ref type="formula">2025</ref>) created GPT-4-generated corpora, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kim and Kim (2025)</ref> recently released KOACD, a Korean dataset augmenting social media data with synthetic samples. Synthetic datasets support balanced and scalable resource creation, but may fail to capture the nu- </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Modelling Approaches</head><p>This section outlines computational approaches to CD detection and classification, grouped into six methodological categories that reflect major developments in the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Rule-Based</head><p>The first systems for CD</p><p>classification were rulebased, using hand-crafted keyword patterns and syntactic features. Wiemer-Hastings et al. (2004) developed COGNO, a system that mapped surface linguistic cues (e.g. verb tense, negation, person markers) to predefined CD categories. It performed well on a 10-class single-label task (Macro-F1 = 0.61) but was only tested on 'polished' textbookstyle CD examples. One of the main strengths of rule-based systems is their interpretability, a feature still highly valued in clinical settings, where transparency is critical. For instance, Lalk et al. (2024) employed a manually curated list of n-grams, based on previous work (Bathina et al., 2021), to monitor distortion frequency in psychotherapy transcripts and predict patient depression severity. 5.2 Traditional Machine Learning (Feature-based) As more annotated corpora became available, early rule-based systems gave way to feature-based statistical models. These approaches combined classic classifiers, such as logistic regression (LR) and support vector machines (SVMs), with engineered features such as Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) scores and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectors. Simms et al. (2017) demonstrated that LR trained on LIWC features performed well on the detection task using Tumblr data, while Shickel et al. (2020) found that TF-IDF with LR outperformed CNNs on a 15-class single-label synthetic dataset (F1 = 0.68), indicating that shallow linguistic cues can remain competitive even in classification tasks. Similarly, Shreevastava and Foltz (2021) used SVM with smooth inverse frequency (SIF) embeddings, achieving strong performance (F1 = 0.77) on the detection task despite the insensitivity of SIF to word order. 5.3 Deep Learning with Static Embeddings Static word embeddings such as Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) introduced vector-based representations of words derived from co-occurrence patterns. These effectively captured word similarity but failed to account for contextual nuance (e.g., 'riverbank' vs 'bank'). Despite this limitation, such embeddings formed the backbone of early deep-learning based CD classifiers. For example, Rojas-Barahona et al. (2018) combined GloVe with CNNs for multi-label CD classification, outperforming traditional models. Similarly, Mostafa et al. (2021) trained LSTM models using GloVe vectors to classify different CD types, although their findings highlighted concerns around overfitting due to the use of limited and synthetic data. To address data sparsity in Arabic texts, Alhaj et al. (2022) applied contextual topic modelling (CTM), integrating static embeddings with domain-specific topic information via</p><p>BERTopic -an approach that proved helpful in lowresource settings. While static embeddings offered richer representations than earlier methods, their inability to capture context, especially for polysemous words and subtle pragmatic distinctions, ultimately led to the rise of contextual models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Transformer-based Architectures</head><p>Transformers, particularly BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref>, introduced contextual embeddings that capture word meaning based on the surrounding sentence, marking a significant leap forward in many NLP tasks, including CD detection and classification. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Shreevastava and Foltz (2021)</ref> used fine-tuned Sentence-BERT (SBERT) for binary CD detection, showing notable improvements over earlier models. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lybarger et al. (2022)</ref> demonstrated that incorporating conversational history further improves classification performance on therapy dialogues. Domain-adapted transformers like MentalBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ji et al., 2022)</ref>, which are pre-trained on mental-health-related data, showed benefits over general-purpose models, while augmentation techniques such as mixup <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Zhang et al., 2018)</ref> were explored to improve performance on rare CD classes (minor improvements). <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Maddela et al. (2023)</ref> found that models like RoBERTa performed better than larger language models such as GPT-3.5 for this task, though distinguishing between closely related distortions remained a challenge. Overall, transformers brought significant gains in robustness and accuracy, but these came at the cost of reduced interpretability and a higher risk of overfitting, especially in datasets with extreme class imbalance. These limitations set the stage for the emergence of prompt-based models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">LLMs and Prompting Frameworks</head><p>LLMs like GPT-3 have enabled CD detection through natural language prompting, allowing models to perform the task without the need for tailored training. Recent work in this area can broadly be divided into two approaches: zero-shot prompting and chain-of-thought frameworks.</p><p>Zero-shot prompting.</p><p>Chen et al. (2023) introduced Diagnosis-of-Thought (DoT) prompting, guiding LLMs to reason through CD detection and classification with structured outputs. While this method sometimes outperformed fine-tuned transformers on the THERAPISTQA corpus, it also is prone to hallucinations and inconsistent rationales, especially on ambiguous cases. Similarly, Pico et al. (2025) compared multiple LLMs, finding that well-prompted open-source models could approach the performance of larger proprietary models, though results were not always consistent across runs. Chain-of-thought (CoT). Lim et al. (2024) presented the ERD framework, where multiple LLM agents simulate therapist-like reasoning, extracting emotional cues and providing structured explanations. Though this method produced richer rationales, it was highly sensitive to how prompts were designed and faced challenges in scalability and validation. Another key application of LLMs has been synthetic data generation. For example, Babacan et al. ( <ref type="formula">2025</ref>) used GPT-4 to create a balanced CD dataset. While initial results were promis-ing, the synthetic data struggled to generalise to the noisier, more complex language found in realworld user inputs. Overall, prompted LLMs offer advantages in reducing training costs and improving interpretability, but they remain limited by issues such as prompt fragility, hallucinations, and inconsistent evaluation results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Multimodal and Multi-task Architectures</head><p>To overcome the limitations of text-only models, recent research has explored incorporating additional modalities and joint tasks. Singh et al. ( <ref type="formula">2023</ref>) introduced CODEC, a multimodal dataset combining video, audio, and text from therapy simulations. By leveraging intonation and facial expressions, their model achieved improvements in detecting emotion-related CDs such as Emotional Reasoning. Building on CODEC, Singh et al. ( <ref type="formula">2024</ref>) developed CODER, which added annotated reasoning spans to support explanation-aware CD classification. Multi-task learning has also been employed to utilise the diagnostic value of CDs. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lee et al. (2021)</ref> repurposed micromodel outputs to improve depression and PTSD prediction, while <ref type="bibr">Wang et al. (2023b)</ref> demonstrated that incorporating CD frequency improved mental illness detection pipelines. These architectures have shown promise in boosting robustness, particularly in low-resource or noisy data settings. However, the scarcity of multimodal datasets and challenges around annotation and privacy continue to hinder wider adoption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7">Feasibility of Meta-Analysis</head><p>While we initially intended to include comparative performance tables, meaningful aggregation proved infeasible. The studies diverge across critical axes -(i) task formulation, (ii) CD taxonomy choice, (iii) dataset domain, (iv) evaluation metrics, (v) granularity of the unit of analysis, (vi) context inclusion and window size, and (vii) modalityoften incompatibly. Sample sizes within aligned subgroups are too small for robust comparison, and IAA is reported inconsistently, further limiting comparability. Pooled tables would therefore risk suggesting misleading trends. We release the full set of extracted results in our GitHub repository, enabling researchers to build their own comparisons. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to qualitative synthesis, deferring formal meta-analysis until the evidence base is larger and more standardised.</p><p>Despite progress in CD classification, evaluation practices remain inconsistent, with studies differing markedly in their choice and reporting of metrics, which hinders comparability. Although F1 score is the most commonly used metric, distinctions between macro, micro, and weighted variants are frequently overlooked -a significant issue for class-imbalanced datasets where per-class performance is critical. Some studies now report AUPRC (Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve) to account for skewed label distributions, providing a more informative measure of performance on rare CD types <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ding et al., 2022)</ref>. Nonetheless, per-class metrics are still underreported, hiding weaknesses in addressing infrequent distortions. Similarly, dataset quality is often inconsistently assessed. IAA is either inconsistently measured or reported using incomparable metrics. While Cohen's Kappa (κ), which adjusts for chance, is typically more appropriate, many studies instead rely raw agreement or non-standard metrics, blurring the line between annotation reliability and model performance. Baseline comparisons are further complicated by inconsistent CD taxonomies and datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Challenges &amp; Future Directions</head><p>Despite recent progress, the automatic detection and classification of CDs remains a challenging task, both conceptually and computationally. In this section, we outline three key challenges currently limiting the field: (1) inconsistency in CD taxonomies, (2) data scarcity and imbalance, and (3) the overreliance on short-form text. Addressing these issues is essential for improving model performance, evaluation fairness, and eventual clinical applicability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Inconsistent CD Taxonomies</head><p>A longstanding challenge is the lack of a standardised taxonomy for CDs. While foundational frameworks such as the Burns ten-category list (Burns, 1999) are commonly cited, computational studies diverge significantly in how they define, split, or rename distortion types. For instance, Jumping to Conclusions is frequently subdivided into Mind Reading and Fortune Telling, and terms such as All or Nothing Thinking appear under multiple aliases (e.g., Black and White Thinking, Polarised Thinking), making it difficult to compare models across studies, reproduce results, or interpret outputs reliably. These inconsistencies also affect annotation quality, as ambiguous or overly granular label sets introduce subjectivity and reduce IAA -an issue compounded by the lack of formal guidance on taxonomy use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Data Scarcity, Imbalance, and Annotation Limits</head><p>The field remains constrained by a lack of large, high-quality datasets that capture authentic, context-rich examples of distorted thinking. Clinical corpora are scarce and often inaccessible due to privacy constraints, while many widely used datasets are synthetic, crowd-sourced, or compiled from multiple domains, which may lack the nuance and ambiguity of real-world language. This limits the complexity of distortions that models can learn and typically results in heavy class imbalance, with rare distortion types being underrepresented or excluded altogether. Although augmentation strategies such as mixup or back-translation offer minor gains for rare categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ding et al., 2022)</ref>, a deeper issue lies in the ceiling imposed by annotation reliability itself. In some settings, even expert annotators show limited agreement, particularly for subtle or overlapping categories. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Tauscher et al. (2023)</ref> report that for the presence of 'Any Distortion' in a text, human F1 agreement was 0.63, while a fine-tuned BERT model reached 0.62 -a very small difference. This suggests that for certain formulations, such as binary detection or high-frequency classes, current models may already be approaching the upper bound set by annotation quality. It also reinforces the need for clearer task definitions and more consistent annotation protocols before investing in model complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Overreliance on Short Text</head><p>The vast majority of existing datasets frame CD detection at the sentence or single-utterance level. This simplifies annotation and model design but introduces strong limitations, as many distortions are context-dependent or only weakly signalled lexically. By stripping away discourse-level cues, models are forced to rely on surface-level patterns and may perform poorly on more ambiguous cases.</p><p>Predictably, this has contributed to the dominance of distortion types with overt markers (e.g., Should Statements) in both datasets and model outputs.</p><p>Empirical studies confirm the value of richer context, showing that including prior conversational turns improved detection F1 from 0.68 to 0.73 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lybarger et al., 2022)</ref>, while frameworks such as ERD achieve greater interpretability by explicitly reasoning over multi-sentence inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lim et al., 2024)</ref>. Still, most benchmarks continue to prioritise short-form inputs. Moving forward, we argue that context-aware models should become the norm rather than the exception. In parallel, new datasets should prioritise multi-turn conversations, real patient narratives, and longer-form content that more closely mirrors therapeutic language.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Best Practices and Recommendations</head><p>Alongside consolidating existing research, it is important to address the main sources of fragmentation in the field. We therefore propose a set of best practices for future work, which should be followed where possible or clearly justified if deviated from.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">Taxonomy Adoption</head><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, inconsistent use of CD taxonomies has made cross-study comparison difficult.</p><p>In the absence of a universally accepted taxonomy, we recommend Burns' taxonomy<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">foot_4</ref> (Burns, 1999) as a sensible default, since it is the most widely cited and most alternatives used in NLP are partial reinterpretations of it. Researchers should (i) report the source and rationale for their chosen taxonomy, (ii) avoid introducing new or expanded taxonomies without justification, and (iii) prioritise taxonomies grounded in clinical consensus. Reliance on loosely defined online taxonomies is discouraged. Where deviations from Burns' taxonomy are necessary, the rationale should be documented in the study, or, in the case of new datasets, in the corresponding datasheet, for which we provide a template online.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Unambiguous Evaluation Reporting</head><p>Inconsistent reporting is a major barrier to comparing results across studies. To improve comparability, we recommend that future work (i) clearly state the task formulation (detection, single-label, or multi-label classification; §2), (ii) specify the analysis unit (sentence, turn, session) and, if relevant, document the exact context window, (iii) indicate the CD taxonomy used, (iv) report per-class scores alongside macro and weighted F1<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">foot_5</ref> with unambigu-ous labels, and (v) explain the choice of evaluation metrics. While a single metric cannot suit all applications, departures from macro or weighted F1 should always be accompanied by a clear rationale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3">Dataset Development and Use</head><p>For researchers creating new CD datasets, we recommend providing a datasheet that documents the dataset's origin, annotation protocol, size, taxonomy, analysis unit, and licensing. To support this, we provide a standardised datasheet template in our GitHub repository. For reuse of existing datasets, we encourage researchers to apply our Ethics Flowchart, which provides practical guidance on assessing provenance, consent, and documentation before experimentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4">Annotation Reliability and Inter-annotator Agreement</head><p>Annotation processes should be reported transparently. Researchers should provide standard IAA metrics (e.g., Cohen's κ, Fleiss' κ, Krippendorff's α) rather than vague statements of 'agreement'.</p><p>The rationale for the chosen metric should be stated, and partial dataset sampling for IAA is acceptable provided that procedures are clearly documented. We further recommend that future work (i) reports human-model performance comparison metrics where possible, (ii) prioritises the release of multilingual and multi-domain corpora, and (iii) explicitly documents how annotation disagreements are resolved. Without such practices, gains in model performance may reflect noise-fitting rather than genuine progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.5">Code and Dataset Release</head><p>To support replication and benchmarking, researchers should release code and, where licensing and privacy considerations permit, datasets. As shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, many of the surveyed studies do not provide public implementations. We recommend that future work adopt code and data release as standard practice, in line with recent broader calls for stronger reproducibility standards in AI research and governance <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Semmelrock et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mason-Williams and Mason-Williams, 2025)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Limitations</head><p>While this survey offers a structured overview of methods, datasets, and evaluation practices for CD detection and classification in NLP, it has several limitations. The focus is primarily computational, with limited integration of insights from clinical psychology or cognitive science, and deeper conceptual analyses of CDs are beyond its scope. The survey also centres on English-language datasets and approaches, which may limit generalisability to other languages and cultural contexts. Although emerging work on multimodal and conversational systems is noted, the emphasis remains on textbased methods and classification tasks, rather than auxiliary tasks such as cognitive reframing. Finally, due to space constraints, some datasets and methods could not be covered in detail, and despite systematic efforts, some relevant studies may have been missed.</p><p>As with any literature survey, our analysis is constrained by the scope, reporting quality, and coverage of the included studies, and should be viewed as a snapshot of a rapidly evolving field. As such, some very recent preprints may not be included. While we have aimed for balanced representation, our synthesis reflects our methodological choices and interpretive framing, which may influence the emphasis placed on particular themes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">Ethical Considerations</head><p>Given the nature of CDs within psychotherapy contexts, this survey acknowledges several important ethical considerations. As our work is a synthesis of existing studies, we did not collect new data or propose new models. Nevertheless, the scope of our review touches on certain areas of concern that warrant attention.</p><p>Dataset Origins. Many of the datasets discussed in this survey are derived from sources where individuals may have disclosed personal, and often highly sensitive, information. This is particularly true in domains such as digital mental health platforms, social media, and therapy transcripts. In reviewing these studies, we noted that some datasets have limited publicly available information on certain aspects of their origins or collection processes, often due to constraints inherited from upstream sources.</p><p>For instance, with THERAPISTQA, the authors provide clear documentation -including detailed labelling guidelines and procedures for resolving disagreements between annotators <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Shreevastava and Foltz, 2021)</ref>. However, because the dataset draws on an upstream public source, some provenance details reflect the level of information made available by that original source rather than any omission by the curators themselves. In this case, the publicly available version is based on a Kaggle Q&amp;A dataset,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">foot_6</ref> for which we have not found publicly accessible details specifying the original platform or data collection process. This situation is not unique to THERAPISTQA; several widely used mental health corpora draw on similar repositories, highlighting a broader and ongoing challenge in achieving complete transparency of data origins within the field.</p><p>Linguistic &amp; Cultural Biases. The literature we surveyed remains heavily focused on Englishlanguage data, with only limited, though encouragingly increasing, attention paid to other languages or cultural contexts. This linguistic bias introduces significant limitations, especially given that CDs are almost certainly shaped by cultural norms, stigma, and may manifest quite differently across populations. We repeat calls from prior work for the development and evaluation of more CD classification methods that are sensitive to crosslinguistic and cross-cultural variation.</p><p>Risks of Misuse &amp; Overreliance. We also acknowledge that the automatic detection of CDs carries serious risks if applied irresponsibly, particularly outside of therapeutic settings. Misclassification or over-reliance on automated outputs could result in harm -reinforcing stigma, invalidating personal experiences, or leading to inappropriate interventions. We therefore stress that CD classification systems should not be deployed without careful validation, the involvement of mental health professionals, and appropriate safeguards to protect user autonomy and well-being. As highlighted in Section 5, CD classification performance is variable and often limited on rarer classes. As such, applications in clinical settings should be approached cautiously.</p><p>In presenting this survey, our aim is to support the NLP community in enabling more ethically considerate, transparent, and responsible research practices -particularly when working in sensitive domains such as mental health.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B Psychological Foundations of CDs</head><p>This appendix offers an overview of CDs, providing additional context for NLP researchers who may be unfamiliar with them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.1 What are CDs?</head><p>As introduced in Section 1, CDs, sometimes called thinking errors, are habitual patterns of negatively biased or flawed thinking that shape how people interpret events, evaluate themselves, and respond to the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Beck, 1963)</ref>. There are many different types of CDs, as outlined in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. In this paper, we use the term CD taxonomy to refer to the particular set of CDs adopted in any given NLP study.</p><p>CDs are not restricted to clinical settings, as most people exhibit distorted thinking, often automatically, in response to certain situations (a key aspect studied in CBT). However, in conditions such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, these patterns tend to occur more frequently <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Lalk et al., 2024)</ref>, become harder to shift, and carry a heightened emotional impact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.2 Origins</head><p>The origins of CDs are often traced back to the early work of Beck in the 1960s. While he identified fewer types of distortions than are commonly recognised today, he did describe well-known types such as Overgeneralisation, as well as others that are less frequently cited. Quoted directly from his work (Beck, 1963): 11   • Arbitrary Interpretation -'the process of forming an interpretation of a situation, event, or experience when there is no factual evidence to support the conclusion, or when the conclusion is contrary to the evidence.'</p><p>• Selective Abstraction -'focusing on a detail taken out of context, ignoring other more salient features of the situation, and conceptualising the whole experience on the basis of this element.'</p><p>The concept of CDs gained further traction in the 1980s through the work of David Burns, who outlined a widely used taxonomy of ten CDs in Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy, later revising it in 1999 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Burns, 1999)</ref>. Burns' list more closely resembles the taxonomies commonly used in NLP studies today.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.3 Context &amp; Clinical Relevance</head><p>Although this survey focuses on computational approaches to CD detection and classification, it is important to situate this area within its broader psychological context. Several therapeutic frameworks address distorted thinking, either directly or indirectly. For example:</p><p>11 Both Arbitrary Interpretation and Selective Abstraction align reasonably well with the consolidated taxonomy reference in Table 1, corresponding to Jumping to Conclusions and Mental Filter, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT)</head><p>where the focus is on the identification and challenge of irrational beliefs, which are broader than the discrete thought patterns typically considered as CDs. REBT focuses on core value beliefs (e.g., 'I must be the best') that tend to underlie many distortions, aiming to replace them with rational alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ellis, 1957</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ellis, , 1994;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dryden, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Schema therapy moves past the present-moment focus of traditional CBT by addressing deep rooted, and often unhelpful, patterns, which are known as schemas. These can develop in childhood when core emotional needs are not met. Such schemas can lead to ongoing problems in how a person thinks, feels, behaves, and relates to others, often requiring longer term and more intensive treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Young et al., 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</head><p>does not frame problematic thinking in terms of CDs, but instead chooses to recognise unhelpful thoughts as a normal part of human thinking. The focus is not on challenging the content of these thoughts, but on changing the individual's relationship to them through various strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hayes et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>While these approaches differ in focus, they generally agree on the importance of recognising distorted thinking patterns as a route to improved emotional or behavioural regulation. This clinical grounding remains a key motivation behind the computational modelling of CDs.</p></div>
