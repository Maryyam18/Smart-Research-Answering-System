<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Integrated visible light positioning and communication (VLPC), capable of combining advantages of visible light communications (VLC) and visible light positioning (VLP), is a promising key technology for the future Internet of Things. In VLPC networks, positioning and communications are inherently coupled, which has not been sufficiently explored in the literature. We propose a robust power allocation scheme for integrated VLPC Networks by exploiting the intrinsic relationship between positioning and communications. Specifically, we derive explicit relationships between random positioning errors, following both a Gaussian distribution and an arbitrary distribution, and channel state information errors. Then, we minimize the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of positioning errors, subject to the rate outage constraint and the power constraints, which is a chanceconstrained optimization problem and generally computationally intractable. To circumvent the nonconvex challenge, we conservatively transform the chance constraints to deterministic forms by using the Bernstein-type inequality and the conditional value-atrisk for the Gaussian and arbitrary distributed positioning errors, respectively, and then approximate them as convex semidefinite programs. Finally, simulation results verify the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed integrated VLPC design schemes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>As predicted by Cisco, over 500 billion Internet of Things (IoT) devices will be connected to the Internet globally by 2030, and about 80% of the mobile traffic occurs in indoor environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This would also lead to growing demands for indoor location-based services, which are supported by accurate positioning and high data rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The related applications include smart manufacturing, safety monitoring, logistics management, and indoor navigation. For indoor environments, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals are usually weak due to the multipath effect and signal blocking. Meanwhile, conventional radio frequency (RF) based indoor positioning approaches, e.g., Wi-Fi, radio frequency identification (RFID), and ultra-wideband (UWB), generally suffer from electromagnetic interference, sensitivity to the changing environment, and multipath effects. Besides, the RF spectrum scarcity is also a challenging issue as the number of electronic devices sharing it becomes large.</p><p>Visible light positioning and communications (VLPC) provide alternative solutions for indoor location-based services. At present, most of the existing works study visible light positioning (VLP) and visible light communications (VLC) separately <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Some recent advances in integrated VLPC S. Ma is with the Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen 518055, China. (email: mash01@pcl.ac.cn) networks motivate us to investigate a unified system, capable of fulfilling the requirements of both positioning and communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Specifically, in the integrated VLPC network, both the positioning and communication operations can be jointly optimized via the shared use of a single hardware platform and a joint signal processing framework. Owing to its inherent advantages, including, but not limited to, no electromagnetic interference, low multipath effects, and low deployment cost, integrated VLPC networks have drawn more and more research attention in both industrial and academic communities.</p><p>For VLP, there are many positioning algorithms based on received signal strength (RSS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, hybrid RSS/angle of arrival (AOA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, time of arrival (TOA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, time difference of arrival (TDOA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and the maximum likelihood estimators <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, a position estimation deep neural network (PE-DNN) aided VLC receiver was designed to achieve data transmission and location positioning simultaneously. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the authors experimentally demonstrated an indoor VLC and a VLP system using the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). The integrated VLPC system also was proposed by other different modulations or signal processing, such as code division multiple access (CDMA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, m-CAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, retroreflectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and adaptive feedback threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Based on the reinforcement learning framework, an intelligent resource allocation scheme was studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> for integrated VLC and VLP systems, where the sum rate is maximized subject to the constraints of minimum data rates and positioning accuracy. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, an OFDMA-based integrated VLPC system was proposed to estimate the receiver's position based on the power of the data sequence. By using filter bank multicarrier-based subcarrier multiplexing (FBMC-SCM) and phase difference of arrival, the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> experimentally tested the integrated VLPC system. Based on FBMC-SCM, a joint subcarrier and power allocation method was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> for multi-cell integrated VLPC systems to maximize the sum rate under both the minimum data rate and positioning accuracy constraints. For the integrated VLPC IoT network <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, the authors jointly optimized AP selection, bandwidth allocation, adaptive modulation, and power allocation to maximize the data rate. Note that, in the above existing literature, the estimated position information is not fully utilized in the data transmission. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, the relationship between channel gain distributions and UE's position and orientation was studied, and the symbol error probability was derived based on the least-square channel estimation and channel gain distributions, while the relationship between positioning and communication performance is not revealed. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, the intrinsic relationship</p><p>• Based on the derived the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of VLP and achievable rates of VLC, we describe the relationship between positioning errors and channel estimation errors for the integrated VLPC network, and there exists an optimal tradeoff relationship between the VLP and VLC. On the one hand, VLP can enhance VLC, i.e., location information can be used to increase the information transmission signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and rate. On the other hand, VLP and VLC are mutually restricted. Both positioning accuracy and communication rate depend on the allocated power. Moreover, positioning accuracy affects channel estimation error, and channel estimation error further affects the communication rate. To our best knowledge, this inherent coupling between VLP and VLC is revealed for the first time.</p><p>• Next, we propose a robust power allocation optimization framework to minimize the CRLB of VLP subject to the rate outage chance constraint and the optical and electrical power constraint. This chance-constrained optimization problem is generally intractable. Meanwhile, due to the matrix inverse, the problem usually is nonconvex, which make the problem more challenging.</p><p>-For Gaussian distributed positioning errors, we conservatively transform the chance constraint to a deterministic form, based on the Bernstein-type inequality to circumvent the intractability of the chance constraints. Furthermore, the non-convex deterministic form constraints are approximated by a convex form based on the matrix norm feature. -Arbitrary distributed positioning errors are a more practical scenario to cover Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions, where only the mean and variance are known, but the distribution form is uncertain. To tackle a variety of the chance constraint on the uncertainty set, the worst-case distribution of the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is conservatively approximated to a more tractable form. Then, by adopting successive convex approximation (SCA), the joint nonconvex optimization problem can be transformed into a series of convex subproblems.</p><p>Finally, both of these probability-constrained problems can be reformulated as a convex semidefinite program (SDP), which can be solved by the interior point method. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We present the VLPC system model in Section II. The key performance metrics for the VLPC system are derived in Section III. In Section IV, we investigate the chance-constrained robust integrated VLPC design. Extensive simulation results are presented in Section V. Section VI concludes the paper.

SYSTEM MODEL As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), consider an integrated VLPC network that includes a central controller, M ≥ 3 noncollinear LEDs, photodetector-based user equipment (UE), such as robots and automated guided vehicles move on the factory ground, where u</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= [x u , y u , z u ] T and v i = [x i , y i , z i ]</formula><p>T denote the locations of the UE and the i-th LED (i ∈ M), respectively.

Besides, the allocated frequencies f p,i is an ID of ith LED to distinguish the source of the positioning signals.</p><p>For the positioning subframe with the duration T p , M LEDs simultaneously transmit positioning signals to the UE, which can estimate the RSS. Although the center controller can use the RSS information to calculate the UE's location, the issues of the UE privacy and the computing load at the center controller make it reasonable that the UE directly undertakes all the computation tasks. Thus, we assume that the UE is powerful enough to perform the positioning, channel state information (CSI) estimation, and the joint power allocation for the next subframe. In the uplink feedback subframe, the UE only feeds back the CSI and the result of the power allocation to the center controller by infrared communications or RF communications. Finally, the center controller deploys the power allocation results, and selects the LED with the best CSI to transmit data to the UE during the next downlink data subframe. The model can be extended into the multi-UE scenario through a proper multiple-access protocol, which can refer to the classical theory of multi-user networks. For example, based on the TDMA, each UE will be independently served at the allocated slot, which is equivalent to the single-UE case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Downlink Positioning Subframe</head><p>In the positioning subframe, the UE estimates the RSS based on the received signals from LEDs. Specifically, for t ∈ [0, T p ], the i-th LED transmits the positioning symbol s p,i (t), where -A ≤ s p,i (t) ≤ A, E {s p,i (t)} = 0, E s 2 p,i (t) = ε, A &gt; 0 and ε &gt; 0. For brevity, we drop the time index t throughout the paper, where s p,i (t) is denoted by s p,i . Hence, the transmitted positioning signal x p,i of the i-th LED is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x p,i = P p,i s p,i + I DC , ∀i ∈ M,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where P p,i indicates the allocated positioning power of the i-th LED, and I DC &gt; 0 denotes the direct current (DC) bias. At the UE side, the received light is detected by the PD and usually travels via the line of sight (LOS) and diffuse links, and a DC blocking circuit is adopted to filter the DC component. The received positioning signal y p,i from the i-th LED can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">y p,i = g i P p,i s p,i + n p,i , ∀i ∈ M,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where g i is the channel gain between the i-th LED and the UE, and n p,i is the zero-mean Gaussian noise N 0, σ 2 p . Generally, the channel gain g i can be decomposed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">g i g i,LOS + g i,diffuse , i ∈ M,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where g i,LOS and g i,diffuse are the channel gains of the LOS and diffuse links between the i-th LED and the UE, respectively. For the LOS link, the channel gain g i,LOS is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">g i,LOS = (m+1)ηcη ℓ AR 2πd 2 i cos m (φ i ) cos (ψ i ) , |ψ i | ≤ ψ FoV ; 0, otherwise,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where m ln 2 ln cos φ 1 2 is the Lambertian index of the LED, φ 1 2 denotes the semi-angle, A R is the effective area of PD, η c is the electric-optical conversion coefficient, η ℓ is the optical-electric conversion coefficient, ψ FoV indicates the FoV of PD, d i denotes the distance from the i-th LED to the UE, φ i denotes the angle of irradiance of the i-th LED, and ψ i denotes the angle of the PD incidence from the i-th LED.</p><p>On the other hand, the CSI of the diffuse links is always unknown, and the gain of the LOS link is significantly higher than that of the diffuse link <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Therefore, to simplify the analysis, we assume that the diffuse links can be ignored, and only the LOS link needs to be considered, i.e., g i = g i,LOS .</p><p>Finally, according to the frequency components of the received positioning signal, the UE can detect which LED is in the UE's FoV and estimate the RSS. Let M ⊂ M denote the set of the received LED's index, and p y u,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">{v i } i∈ M [p y,i , ...]</formula><p>T ∈ R M denote the power vector of the received signals {y p,i } i∈ M from the M received LEDs to the UE, where p y,i = E y 2 p,i . Without loss of generality, we assume that P p,i = 0, i / ∈ M.</p></div>

Positioning and Channel Estimation</head><p>When at least 3 non-collinear LEDs can be received, using the RSS-based positioning method, the UE's location estimation can be transformed into a RSS-related estimation problem. For example, utilizing the least squares method <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, the positioning result of the UE can be solved by û = arg min û p y u,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">{v i } i∈ M -p ŷ û, {v i } i∈ M 2 ,</formula><p>where p ŷ û, {v i } i∈ M denotes the corresponding received power vector at the UE's Location û ∈ R 3 . Thus, the positioning error e p is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">e p = u -û.<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Generally, the positioning error e p is assumed to follow two typical probability distribution models: Gaussian distribution and arbitrary distribution.</p><p>• Gaussian distribution: If only the mean and variance are known, the Gaussian distribution can maximize the entropy of the uncertain parameter without additive constraints. This model has been adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> because the CRLB is asymptotically achieved by the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator even for finite data size <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. • Arbitrary distribution: The location estimators based on approximate ML <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, and multidimensional scaling (MDS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> can also achieve the CRLB. However, the estimation errors do not necessarily follow a Gaussian distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. In this case, although the distribution of the position error e p is unavailable, its mean and variance also can be assumed to be known <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>Based on the RSS p y u, {v i } i∈ M and the signal {x p,i } i∈ M, we can select the i * -th LED to transmit the downlink data, which is assumed to correspond to the maximum channel gain, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">i * = arg max i∈ M Tp 0 y p,i (t) s p,i (t) dt P p,i Tp 0 s 2 p,i (t) dt = arg max i∈ M g i + Tp 0 n p,i (t) s p,i (t) dt P p,i εT p ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>and the corresponding LED location is</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">v i * = [x i * , y i * , z i * ] T .</formula><p>If only the LOS link is considered, according to the channel model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>), the estimated CSI ĝi * between the i * -th LED and the UE is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">ĝi * = (m + 1) η c η ℓ A R (z i * -ẑu ) m+1 2π û -v i * m+3 = µ(z i * -ẑu ) m+1 û -v i * m+3 ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where µ = (m+1)ARηcη ℓ 2π .

ROBUST INTEGRATED VLPC DESIGN</head><p>For any given distribution of the positioning errors, it is hard to design an integrated VLPC scheme for the UE, which always meets the positioning or throughput requirements due to the unbounded errors. However, it is reasonable to make a robust design within the tolerance of uncertainty in practice. In this section, we investigate a chance-constrained robust integrated VLPC design for the two types of positioning error distributions: Gaussian distribution and arbitrary distribution. Specifically, by exploiting the relationship between positioning errors and CSI errors, we focus on designing a VLPC power allocation scheme to minimize the CRLB of VLP under the QoS chance constraint and power constraints.</p></div>

Comparing with Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, the CVaR-based scheme provides a higher communication rate than the Bernstein-based scheme for the same scenario. Thus, the CVaR-based scheme is more robust than the scheme based on the Bernstein-type inequality, because of less utilized prior information. On the other hand, the CVaR-based scheme can be applied widely in practical scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. CRLB Versus the Rate Threshold</head><p>In this subsection, we show the relationship between the positioning error and the communication requirement for the nonrobust and two proposed robust schemes. The square root of the CRLB versus the achievable rate threshold r is investigated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>(a) and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>(b) under the Gaussian and arbitrary positioning error distributed assumptions, respectively. To represent the average performance, it is assumed that there is only the LOS channel, and the UE's location estimation is the actual position, i.e., û = u.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>(a) shows the results under the Gaussian distributed assumption with M = 3, 6 LEDs, and the maximum tolerable outage probabilities are P out = 0.01, P out = 0.15 and nonrobust case. Since û = u, the nonrobust case is equivalent to the perfect positioning case. We observe that the positioning performance degrades as the minimum rate requirement increases, which means that there is a tradeoff between the communication performance and the positioning precision. When the LED number is fixed, and the rate threshold r is low enough, such as r ≤ 150Mbps, the CRLB changes slowly. However, if r is high enough, it degrades rapidly.

On the other hand, the CRLB can be obviously reduced as the LED number increases from M = 3 to M = 6.</p><p>Comparing with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>(a), Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5(b</ref>) is set to the same scenario except for the distribution assumption, and there are similar trends of the CRLB versus the rate for different parameters. However, the CVaR-based scheme leads to more drastic positioning performance loss versus the rate threshold r and the outage probabilities threshold P out .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Power Allocation Versus the Rate Threshold</head><p>To further derive the performance tradeoff between communication and positioning, the power allocation results versus the rate threshold are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, assuming Gaussian and arbitrary distributed positioning error, respectively. Other design parameters are the same as those in Section V-B.</p><p>From Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, the allocated communication power P * c increases as the minimum rate requirement r increases, and the rate of change also increases continuously. To minimize the CRLB, the remaining power is always allocated to the positioning signals as much as possible within the constraints. For problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, and (39), the allocated positioning power M i=1 P * p,i should satisfy min P total -P * c , M Pp . Due to the limited total power, M i=1 P * p,i will decrease as the minimum rate requirement r increases, which leads to the CRLB degradation.</p><p>In addition, more power will be allocated to VLC, if a stricter outage probability constraint or a more robust power 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290 300 (a) 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290 300 (b) Fig. 7: Power allocation pp and Pc versus rate thresholds r under the assumption of the arbitrary distributed positioning error ep with the fixed UE's location estimation û = u, only the LOS link, and different numbers of LEDs (a) M = 3; (b) M = 6.</p><p>allocation scheme is adopted. This causes the sort of achievable rates in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. When other settings are the same, the achievable rate with P out = 0.01 is the highest, and the rate of the nonrobust case is the lowest. Meanwhile, the CVaR-based scheme provides a higher communication rate than the Bernstein-based scheme for the same scenario. This is also the reason for the variation of the CRLB, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> with different parameters and schemes. According to ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>), (26c) and (39b), the positioning error distribution can directly influence the distribution of the channel estimation error. Although the allocated positioning power with M = 3 LEDs approximates the power with M = 6 LEDs in both Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, the more LEDs can improve the positioning performance, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>. Thus, it can reduce the variance of the channel estimation error to increase the LED number. For communication, the conservatism of the robust schemes can be mitigated, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Cumulative Distribution Functions of Positioning Errors</head><p>To evaluate the positioning performance loss of robust VLPC schemes, the RSS-based triangulation process was simulated with only the LOS link and the LOS+diffuse link. The location is estimated using the nonlinear least squares method. Besides, the positioning error is calculated using the root-square error (RSE). The CDFs of positioning errors are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>.</p><p>From both Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>(a) and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>(b), two robust VLPC power allocation schemes lead to only a slight loss of positioning precision. Thus, the proposed robust power allocation schemes are also effective for VLP. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this work, we investigated the inherent coupling between VLP and VLC through the relationship between the optical channel and the location. In other words, channel estimation can be implemented using the positioning result. After deriving the CRLB for VLP and the achievable rate for VLC, we unveiled the tradeoff between VLP and VLC by the relationship between the channel estimation error and the positioning error. Furthermore, we proposed two robust power allocation schemes for VLPC to minimize the CRLB under the power constraints and QoS requirements, where the positioning error distributions are assumed to follow either the Gaussian distribution or an arbitrary distribution with a known mean and variance. Under the Gaussian distributed assumption, the Bernstein-type inequality is utilized to tackle the communication rate outage constraints, and the problem was converted into a stricter convex SDP by exploiting the matrix norm. For the arbitrary distributed case, the problem was approximated by a more tractable form through the worstcase CVaR and SCA based on the first-order Taylor expansion. Finally, our simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of our two proposed robust VLPC power allocation schemes for both localization and communications.
