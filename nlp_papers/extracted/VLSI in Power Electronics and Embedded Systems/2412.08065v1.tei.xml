<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE effective implementation of machine learning models, such as deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) relies heavily on the availability and quality of the data. As machine learning methods gain prominence in power system studies, the role of data has become increasingly critical. Given the challenges of obtaining real-world power system data, most research relies on data generated by power system simulators. This is especially true for time-domain simulations (TDSs), as existing power grids operate far from the stability boundaries, making collecting sufficient data on instability events challenging. In addition, there is always a risk of perturbations or faults occurring at various locations for large power systems. Dynamic simulators can provide a detailed and interactive power system model, enabling engineers to anticipate and analyze various fault scenarios and system responses. This includes simulations ranging from simple single-device faults to complex interactions involving multiple devices. Through these simulations, the future safety state of the system and the effectiveness of control strategies can be assessed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Machine learning methods require a large amount of data from power system simulators to accurately model power system dynamics and implement control following perturbations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Power system simulators can be categorized into commercial and open-source simulators. Commercial simulators typically require a license but offer comprehensive user documentation, extensive functionality, highly specialized tools, as well as frequent software updates and feature upgrades. However, the advantage of open-source simulators is that they are usually free and highly customizable. Users can modify and improve the code according to specific needs, and new methods and technologies may be adopted more quickly. For example, ANDES is significantly easier to use for developing differential-algebraic equation (DAE)-based power system dynamic models compared to most commercial simulators, while maintaining high numerical efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Considering the ease of access and flexible scalability, open-source dynamic simulators are essential for academic research.</p><p>The existing power system simulator includes functionalities, such as power flow (PF), continuation power flow (CPF), optimal power flow (OPF), small-signal stability analysis (SSSA), and TDS. PF, CPF, and OPF are primarily based on static models to analyze the steady-state behavior under specific load and generation conditions. By contrast, SSSA and TDS utilize dynamic models to evaluate the system's dynamic response and stability following perturbations. Static modelsbased simulators have been well-developed, like MATPOWER <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, Pandapower <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, PowerSimulations.jl <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, PyPSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, PowerModels <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, PowerModelsDistribution.jl <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, OpenDSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and GridLAB-D <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Among these, PowerModelsDistribution.jl, OpenDSS and GridLAB-D are primarily used for distribution systems. Due to the evolution of dynamic model structures and control methods, along with the level of modeling details required to capture specific phenomena of interest, there are variations in the support for dynamic models across different simulators. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> have conducted comprehensive surveys of various power system dynamic simulators, such as power system toolbox (PST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and power system analysis toolbox (PSAT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. However, with the evolution of power systems and the emergence of new models, such as those for inverter-based resources (IBRs), there is a need to conduct surveys on the latest dynamic simulators in recent years.</p><p>This paper first introduces the definitions of TDSs, IBRs, and machine learning applications. It then surveys five leading open-source power system dynamic simulators that support grid-forming (GFM) inverters. Numerical studies are conducted on the IEEE 14-bus system to compare the performance of the simulators with different GFM controls.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Time-Domain Simulation</head><p>TDS is categorized into quasi-static phasor (QSP) simulation and electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation, distinguished by the simulation speed and the level of modeling details necessary for capturing specific phenomena of interest. QSP simulations represent the dynamics of transmission system circuits as discrete changes between steady-state operating points and are used for studying low-frequency phenomena, ranging from inertial response to frequency regulation. EMT simulations incorporate sufficient detail to capture fast dynamic phenomena, enabling the analysis of line dynamics, converter switching, machine fluxes, and lightning surges <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Furthermore, QSP simulation is divided into the positive sequence, root mean square (RMS) unbalanced, dq0-model with algebraic network, and RMS dynamic phasors. On the other hand, EMT is categorized into dq0-model, dynamic Phasors, and waveform simulation (ignores or includes switching model). The classification of TDS is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TDS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Inverter-Based Resource</head><p>Traditional inverters use grid-following (GFL) control, relying on the phase-locked loop (PLL) to estimate and track the angle of the terminal voltage and regulate the injected current into the grid. However, GFL inverters, while unable to actively control voltage and frequency, behave similarly to a current source. When facing a contingency, GFL will act with a delay and cannot mimic the instantaneous response of synchronous generators (SGs), which leads to poorer system response performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. On the other hand, GFM can directly control their voltage and frequency output to inherently enhance system stability and respond to load variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The GFM source acts as a controllable voltage source and does not need the stiff terminal voltage assumption made in GFL <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In emergencies like grid failure or islanded mode, GFM inverters establish the grid voltage, which then serves as the reference voltage for the rest of the system.</p><p>Several GFM controls have been proposed in recent years. Droop control, which mimics the speed droop mechanism present in SGs is widely used. Then, virtual synchronous machine (VSM) control emulates the dynamics and control of SGs and can provide inertia. Matching control structurally matches the differential equations of an inverter to those of an SG. However, virtual oscillator control (VOC) mimics the synchronizing behavior of Liénard-type oscillators and can globally synchronize an IBR-based power system. Furthermore, dispatchable VOC (dVOC) has been proposed to address the issue that the nominal power injection of VOC cannot be specified <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The structures of the most widely used droop control and VSM control are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Machine Learning Application</head><p>Generally, the applications of machine learning in power systems can be divided into two categories: one focuses on forecasting, prediction, estimation, and surrogate modeling, primarily using DL; the other involves optimization, regulation, and control based on RL <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. DL methods typically require a large amount of data to accurately fit the dynamic trajectory of power systems following perturbations. However, since power systems operate with significant safety margins, dynamic data post-fault is difficult to obtain, and most existing research relies on data generated by power system simulators. To generate data, random or distribution-based Monte Carlo sampling of power system variables is necessary to cover a wide range of possible operating scenarios. These power system variables include SG and IBR active power outputs, SG and IBR bus voltage magnitudes, active and reactive power demands of loads, IBR control modes and parameters, as well as fault or perturbation locations and types, etc. RL are traditionally categorized into four types: model-based, modelfree, value iteration, and policy iteration RL <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. When considering constraints, safe RL has been proposed to maximize rewards while ensuring constraint satisfaction through a series of specially designed techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. DL depends on dynamic simulators to perform TDSs for various scenarios and perturbations, generating large amounts of simulation data to train machine learning models. In contrast, RL requires extensive interaction with the environment, performing actions, receiving rewards and states, and iteratively training the model. The environment here can be a real-world system, a dynamic simulator, or a DL-based surrogate model. The interaction between DL, RL, and simulators is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, when applied to machine learning tasks, dynamic simulators must be flexible enough to allow users to easily modify all parameters through code, perform simulations, read results, and operate quickly. Typically, the time required to generate data is closely related to several factors including computer performance, the scale of the system, simulation duration, simulation step size, DAEs solver algorithm, programming language, complexity of the dynamic models, and the type of TDSs. For instance, QSP-based TDSs are signif- icantly faster than EMT-based TDSs, and multi-GPU parallel processing is typically faster than single-GPU processing.</p></div>
