<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Introduction</head><p>In the modern era use of applications and websites have increased the use bank transactions, electronic mail, private messages etc., for these reasons secure communication is very essential. Secure communication requires a process of functions, which insures that the data is not accessed by unauthorized person over an unsecure medium. Thus, in order to build such a process; Cryptography is must.</p><p>Encryption and Decryption are the two functionalities of cryptography <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the method that is designed to prevent unauthorized party/group access to data. In Cryptography the data is first encrypted into unrecognizable message to transfer the data and then its decrypted to its original data at the receiver side.</p><p>Encryption and Decryption are usually implemented using Algorithms that consists of key types <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, such as: Symmetric Key -This algorithm uses the same cryptographic keys for both encryption of original data and decryption of the cipher text. (Encrypted original data) Asymmetric Key -This algorithm uses 2 pairs of key for encryption, the First key is the public key i.e. available to any user while the second key i.e., the secret key is made available to the receiver. Both the key type uses the public key &amp; Private key in order to encrypt the data.</p><p>Over the recent years the internet gave rise to many types of data, and the security of the data gave rise to Cryptography, which in turn gave rise to the implementation of VLSI for encryption and decryption using various techniques. In cryptographic applications, the data sent to a remote host are encrypted at the source machine using an encryption key then the encrypted data are sent to the destination machine, where it's decrypted to get the original data, thereby attacker won't have the encryption key which is required to get the original data. Reprogrammable devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are used for hardware implementations of cryptographic algorithms. As FPGA devices progressed both in terms of resources and performance, the newest FPGAs provide solutions that are easily customizable for system connectivity, DSP, and data processing applications.</p><p>Implementing cryptographic algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> with VLSI has to take into its throughput, memory and power, similar to other VLSI designs. On top of this, the FPGA owner/designer also has to make the design resistant to physical attacks. In order to support the cryptography algorithms the following are needed: secure key storage, random number etc.</p><p>Further on we will discuss the different algorithms with the use of Random bit generation, DNA encryption and so on, implemented using VLSI to encrypt and decrypt images, files, data etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. A Review of Cryptographic Methodologies &amp; Algorithms 1. VLSI Implementation of Text to Image Encryption Algorithm based on Private Key Encryption</head><p>This section conveys a method for text-to-image encryption and decryption using a private key <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The authors Anjali Suresh and Remya Ajai A S <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> proposed this and they tell about the cryptographic applications in this domain, the data sent to a remote host are encrypted at the source machine using an encryption key then the encrypted data are sent to the destination machine, where it's decrypted to get the original data, Field Programmable Gate Arrays are used for the hardware implementation of this algorithm. The implement of the encryption algorithm in FPGA is done using Xilinx ISE and is implemented on low cost Xilinx FPGA SPARTEN 3E.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. TEXT TO IMAGE ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM</head><p>The text-to-image encryption (TTIE) algorithm in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> is shown below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig.1 Encryption of Plaintext</head><p>Each letter in the text file is encrypted into three random integers say R for red, G for green, and B for blue where each random number ranging from 0 to 255. The three random numbers represent one pixel within the image file. This will make it difficult for hackers to attack the data transmitted over a network. This algorithm generates a random pixel R, G, and B values (calling them RGB values) for each letter. During this process the random numbers RGB for all letters are generated and used as keys for encryption, then use the key to transfer plain text into ciphertext. This key's generated at the receiver side, which is employed for decryption later. The result of this process is a two-dimensional array or matrix of pixels in which each pixel represents one letter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. DECRYPTION ALGORITHM:</head><p>The reverse algorithm in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> is shown below,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig.2 Decryption of Plaintext</head><p>The key generated is 24 bits for each character, thus making the length of key 64 bits for all 26 characters (A to Z). This longer key length makes this algorithm stronger or difficult to compute while considering all possible combinations. We have 26 letters and thus the permutations for 26 letters is ((256) 3 ) 26) . For an attacker to do all possible permutations will require many years which is not practical. This makes it stronger compared to other data encryption algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">VLSI Implementation of Text to Image Encryption Algorithm based on Private Key Encryption</head><p>In this section, the authors Ammu S and Remya Ajai A S <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> discuss many aspects of security and many applications, such as secure commerce and payments to private communications and protecting passwords, here cryptography, and steganography comes into play.</p><p>FPGA implementation provides an intermediate solution between general-purpose processors (GPPs) and application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). FPGA configuring software makes use of the broad range of functionality supported by the reconfigurable device. So it has wider applicability than ASIC. FPGA provides a faster hardware solution than a GPP.</p><p>Encryption flowchart is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>: Fig.4 Decryption of Plaintext</p><p>Public key is 32 bit long, but the length of private key is dependent on the plain text. Characters presented are ranging from 0 -255, so the public key length should be maximum of (256*8 bit) i.e. 2048 bit. So there is (2 2048 ) possible combinations of keys are present. To decrypt a message attacker has to check (2 2048 ) combinations of keys. For an attacker to check all the possible combinations will require many years. So this algorithm is very secure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">An Efficient VLSI Architecture for Data Encryption Standard and its FPGA Implementation</head><p>A top-level view of proposed architecture by J. G. Pandey, Aanchal Gurawa, Heena Nehra, A. Karmakar <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref> for the DES algorithm is shown below, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Round Keys Generation Process:</head><p>In proposed DES algorithm, sixteen rounds are required to generate the sixteen round keys. To start the round key generation process, first, a 64-bit input key is provided to the permutation choice-1. The permutation block permutes the input key into 48-bit data, which are provided to two 28-bit blocks. After that, the two 28-bit data are circularly left-shifted by one or two bits, which depends upon the number of rounds as per the DES key generation algorithm. The encryption/decryption operation is managed by the controller.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Controller for the Encryption/Decryption Operation:</head><p>The controller is designed for providing necessary control signals to the proposed architecture. The proposed controller has six different states, which are shown in a form of a finite state machine (FSM). When the asynchronous reset input is at the logic '1' value, the machine resides in the Idle state and generates two control signals, both of these control signals are kept at the logic '0' level. After generating the above control signals, the machine waits for an external input signal, which is used to select the encryption/decryption operation. When the external signal is at logic '1', the machine enters into the Encrypt state otherwise the next state would be a Decrypt state.</p><p>C. Architecture for a Substitution Box:</p><p>The substitution operation consists of a set of eight substitution boxes (S-Boxes). Each S-Box accepts 6bit input and it provides 4-bits output. The S-Boxes can be designed by using only a set of five multiplexers (MUXs). Using this approach, the proposed architecture for the realization of an S-Box using the MUX-based approach is done.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. The Encryption/Decryption Operation:</head><p>The proposed architecture works for both encryptions as well as for decryptions, which depends upon the external input signal. When the signal external input signal is at logic '1', the controller resides in the Encrypt state and it asserts it to logic high. The architecture performs the encryption operation. Similarly, when the external input signal is at logic low in the Decrypt state, the architecture performs the decryption operation.</p><p>The operations are executed sixteen times and it is controlled by the various control signals generated by the controller. After completion of all the rounds, the registered output is available after nineteen clock cycles. Depending on the encryption/decryption operation, which is controlled by the external input signal, the generated output is ciphertext or plaintext.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">VLSI Implementation of Hybrid Cryptography Algorithm Using LFSR Key</head><p>In this research, Shailaja Acholi and Krishnamurthy Ningappa <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref> mentioned about hybrid cryptographic algorithm -Extended Tiny Encryption Algorithm (XTEA) combined with International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) which was implemented for improving the security in real-time applications. The authors implemented this algorithm using Xilinx tool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ID-XT-EA-LFSR algorithm:</head><p>The algorithm proposed by the authors employs five different algebraic operations: addition shift function, bitwise exclusive OR, addition modulo, and multiplication modulo. To increase the performance of both the process, the generation of the key using random numbers plays an important role.</p><p>The ID-XT-EA-LFSR algorithm includes six steps. In the first step, MATLAB is used to read the input image and then is converted into binary format. In the next step, the resulted binary value is converted to text format. This text format is given as input to Verilog. In the fourth step, LFSR is used to generate random numbers which is the key input to Verilog. The output of Verilog is then converted into text format. The resulted values are converted back to the pixels, and then in final step, pixel values are converted into an image.</p><p>Hybrid cryptosystem consists of the initial stage of the XTEA architecture in the first half and in the second half, it includes IDEA architecture which is based on modulo multiplication. 8-bits data block is divided into 2-cycles of 4-bit each, and are represented as 𝑣 [0] and 𝑣 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The initial part is a permutation and the second part is sub-key generation. The sum function is used to select sub key block which is based on the 0th and 1st bits. In the encryption and decryption process, operations like XOR, addition, multiplication, and shift are used. The bits of 𝑣 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> are shifted right and left by 5 and 4 respectively. The results of shift operations are XORed with each other. Then the value resulted by XORed is added to 𝑣 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. R1 is the result. The delta value of 8 is added with the key. To produce r2, this output is XORed with r1. After this process, 𝑣 [0] is added with the value in r2 to produce r3. In the second stage of the proposed cryptosystem architecture, the initial value of 𝑣 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and the value of r3 is XORed which results in r5. The value in r5 is XNORed with the key which gives r6 as output. The values r5 and r6 are added and the result is XNORed with key. The output is represented by r7 and is added with r6 to give the output r8. The r8 is XORed with 𝑣 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and r3 results into V0 and V1 respectively. To produce the encrypted results V0 and V1 are concatenated. Finally, to get the decrypted results, the encrypted value is given to the 𝑣 [0] and 𝑣 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>LFSR generates random numbers that can be used as keys to transmit ciphers. LFSR is used as a series of flip-flops within the FPGA platform. The number of taps from the chain of the switch register is used for the XOR / XNOR gate. The output of this gate is used as a response at the beginning of the shift register chain, hence the response to the LFSR. When LFSR is operational, the pattern is produced by the flip flops individually by a pseudo-random number. Verilog creates a 4-bit LFSR key. It uses polynomials to make the maximum length of LFSR in a single width.</p><p>The proposed ID-XT-EA-LFSR algorithm was implemented in the FPGA platform. This platform is best suited for VLSI due to its flexibility, low power, and high compatibility compared to the ASIC platform.</p></div>

The first serial in parallel out shift register stores the data bytes in particular clock cycle and sends them to the AES-128 Encryption module for encryption process. The 128-bit encrypted data is transferred to the UART transmitter through parallel in serial out shift register. This AES Encryption module does the encryption operation on 128bit of data using AES algorithm which is a symmetric block cipher that processes data blocks of 128 bits using three different cipher key lengths which are 128, 192 &amp;256 bits .</p><p>UART transmitter module i.e. UART_Tx that frames the 8-bit word coming from AES-128 encryption unit with a START bit is logic 0 at the beginning, and a STOP bit logic 1 at the end of the word and sends the framing information in a serial from the Least Significant Bit (LSB) to the Most Significant Bit (MSB). The architecture of the transmitter will consist of a controller, a data register (XMT_datareg), a data shift register (XMT_shftreg) and a status register (bit count) to count the bits that are transmitted. Load_XMT_datareg signal is asserted to indicate that XMT_datareg now contains the data bus value and that is now transferred to the internal shift register that is XMT_shftreg.</p></div>

DNA cryptography DNA cryptography is a new method providing high security based on DNA nucleotides bases A-Adenine, C-Cytosine, G-Guanine and T-Thymine. In this proposed model P.Vinotha and Deepa Jose used Polymerase Chain Reaction encoding technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref> in which the image to be coded is flanked between primer keys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. DNA ENCODING</head><p>The image is converted to binary values based on the pixel value of the image. Binary code is converted into DNA code shown in Table .1 by providing the bases of DNA in alphabetical order (A, T, C, and G). DNA sequences are designed for the whole picture of high pixel values 0-255. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref> BINARY CODE</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">DNA CODE 00 A 01 C 10 G 11 T Table.1 DNA ENCODING</formula><p>The natural structure of DNA is expressed in the form of PCR Encoding technique.

ENCRYPTION KEY In this method, the ciphertext was created by insert alphabets, symbols, and special characters into the base of the DNA codon of length 4. The possible combination of DNA codons is 256 to increase the key size. These are 256 the combination of keys and their DNA sequence serve as the encryption key between the sender and the recipient.

The chances of a successful guess are the attacker is given P (SG of Key) = 1 / (4^64) The total probability of successful guess by an attacker is P (SG of Key) = 1 / (1.63 * 10^8 * 16! * 4 * 4^64) 2. Key Used in DNA Based PCR Encoding Technique In the proposed model the maximum length used in the PCR DNA coding techniques approx. 256 DNA bases. It produces a combination of about 4^256 keys. Chances are a successful guess by the attacker is given P (SG of Key) = 1 / (4^256) The total probability of successful guess by an attacker is P (SG of Key) = 1 / (1.63 * 10^8 * 16! * 4 * 4^256) The length of the four nucleotide sequences increases the base of the key up to 256.

The three main components of the DES encryption/decryption computing scheme are key generation, controller, and an encryption/decryption engine. The key generation block is used to take 64bit input keys and it generates sixteen, 48-bit round keys for the sixteen individual rounds. The main building blocks of the proposed architecture have been arranged in different subsections, which are described below.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,72.00,72.00,216.00,157.15" type="bitmap" /></figure>

The transfer channel should add more data in data to be transferred. • DNA code: Two-way A-'00 ', T-'01', C-'10 ', G-'11' of 8-bit form. 10 00 11 01 (141) → GATC DNA code is converted into ciphertext by considering the nucleotides of the fourth base providing a key combination of four bases. • Final text is the same part containing full values, alphabets, specials letters, and symbols in the DNA data format. • Primer key made by PRBS in the form of DNA sequences is converted into text and embedded text messages are inserted between these primer keys. • Ciphertext is converted to an encrypted image using MATLAB. The initial encryption key and sequence are shared between sender and recipient at a type of microdots or other communication systems.C. KEY GENERATION (OTP) USING PRBSPrimer keys are generated by the process of producing an OTP key (One Time Pad) with the help Pseudo-Random Sequence Generator (PRBS)<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>.
