Another possibility is to probe the scrambling dynamics by the correlation between subsystems, e.g. the entanglement entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, mutual information <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and tripartite information <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. However, these quantities do not directly describe the amount of information that can be extracted from a subsystem and thus may not be sufficient to describe the dynamics of information flow.</p><p>To study the scrambling dynamics of quantum systems directly from the quantum information perspective, we consider Holevo information, which, by definition, describes the information encoded in an ensemble of quantum states <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.

Quantum channel scenery for probing information scrambling dynamics. One encodes H-bits of information into H arbitrarily chosen qubits of an N -qubit system.

This phenomenon is observed from numerical simulation, and is also confirmed by analytical derivation. We examine the scrambling dynamics through the convergence of the average Holevo information toward its infinite-time limit as the circuit depth grows. We also study the critical behavior near the phase transition points. As the Hovelo information only measures the re-trieved classical information from a quantum system, finally we use coherent information to quantify scrambling of quantum information in the same system and find similar phasetransition-like behavior for the coherent information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. INFORMATION SCRAMBLING IN RANDOM QUANTUM CIRCUITS</head><p>Consider an N -qubit quantum system. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we store H bits of classical information by randomly selecting a subsystem of H qubits and preparing them into an ensemble of pure states p i , |ψ init i with p i = 1 2 H and |ψ init i be the 2 H orthogonal states in computational basis. The system then evolves under a randomly generated Clifford circuit U , after which one part of it E is regarded as the environment and traced out. For the remaining system Q containing n qubits, we can denote the amount of classical information that can be retrieved as χ Q , which is given by the Holevo information</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">χ Q |ψ init i , U = S i p i ρ Q i - i p i S ρ Q i ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ρ Q i = Tr E (U |ψ init i ψ init i |U † )</formula><p>is the output density matrix of the system Q, and S is the von Neumann entropy.</p><p>We adopt the periodic boundary condition for the qubits and consider random circuits of the "brick wall" configuration, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The circuit comprises t layers of alternatingly layered bricks in which each brick represents a uniformly sampled two-qubit random Clifford gate. We denote U t as the set of all possible unitaries constructed in this way with t layers. Note that we choose the Clifford circuit mainly because of the convenience in numerical simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. Also, we specify the set of input quantum states</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">|ψ init i = {|γ 1 γ 2 ...γ H Q H |0...0 others } γi∈{0,1}</formula><p>where Q H is a randomly selected subsystem with H qubits. We can thus write the Holevo information as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">χ Q |ψ init i , U ≡ χ Q,Q H (U ).</formula><p>Note that the choices of Q and Q H are arbitrary and does not need to have any specific spatial pattern.</p><p>After obtaining the Holevo information contained in a randomly selected subsystem from the above setting, we further average over all possible subsystem Q, all possible input states, and all the circuits with the same depth t to get</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">χt n = 1 |U t | 1 |S n | 1 |S H | U ∈Ut Q∈Sn Q H ∈S H χ Q,Q H (U ) , (2)</formula><p>where S k denotes the set of all subsystems with k qubits.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, we numerically compute the long time limit of the Holevo information χ∞ n = lim t→∞ χt n by setting t = 3N . Theoretically, Ω(N ) layers are needed for the initially localized information to propagate over the whole system <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>, and here, we verify the convergence of Holevo information by comparing the results at t = 3N with those at t = 4N . A phase-transition-like behavior can be observed: For small system size n, we are not able to retrieve any information; When n reaches half of the system size, information starts emerging at a constant rate of two bits of classical information per qubit; Finally, the retrievable information</p></div>

For the later convenience to examine the behavior near the phase transition point, we choose N to be multiples of 19.</p><p>For different N we fix its ratio with the encoded classical information as N : H = 19 : 8. The curve becomes sharper around the two phase transition points as N increases. Note that the behavior is similar for generic 1 ≤ H ≤ N . The inset shows the result of finite-size scaling. We focus on the difference ∆ between χ∞ n and the thermodynamic limit χ thermal n when n is chosen to be close to the phase transition point n N = 1 2 (circle) and n N = H+N 2N (cross). Specifically, for n smaller than N 2 we calculate ∆1 = χ∞ n , and for n larger than</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">N +H 2</formula><p>we calculate ∆2 = H -χ∞ n . The blue, red, and green lines are for three different ratios of N : H = 17 : 6, 19 : 8, 21 : 10, respectively. When n, N, H increase under a fixed ratio, ∆1 and ∆2 decay exponentially. For each data point, we sample 10 6 times. The long-time limit is approximated by choosing t = 3N as described in the main text. reaches its maximum value through another sharp nonanalytical change, indicating that all of the initially encoded information can be reliably recovered. We perform finite-size scaling near the two points to further analyze the phase-transition-like behavior. As shown in the inset of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, by fixing a ratio at n N &lt; 1 2 and n N &gt; H+N 2N , respectively, and increasing n, N, H simultaneously, χ∞ n converges exponentially towards its thermodynamic limit. Note that one can get the same value of χ∞ n without averaging over the choice of Q H . This can be understood from the definition of scrambling and from the symmetry of the random unitary group <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Indeed, if the circuit is sampled uniformly over the Nqubit Clifford group, we can calculate theoretically the average Holevo information χ∞ n for arbitrary n, N, H, and it agrees well with the numerical result obtained above for layered random two-qubit Clifford gates. For more details, see Appendix A. Specifically, if we take the thermodynamic limit n, N, H → ∞ with the ratio n N ≡ r n , H N ≡ r H held constant, this theoretical value χ∞ n converges to This further allows us to define the critical exponent</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">1 H χ thermal n =      0 r n ≤ 1 2 (2r n -1)/r H 1 2 &lt; r n ≤ 1 2 (1 + r H ) 1 r n &gt; 1 2 (1 + r H ) .<label>(3) (a) (b) (c)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">k ≡ lim τ →0 + log |f (τ )| log |τ | = 1<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where for the first transition point</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">τ = r n -1 2 , f (τ ) = 1 H χ thermal n</formula><p>and similarly for the second transition point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. INFORMATION SCRAMBLING DYNAMICS</head><p>From the evolution of the Holevo information, we can study the information scrambling dynamics of quantum systems. For example, here we study how the long-time limit of the average Holevo information is approached. We compare the average Holevo information for different subsystem sizes { χt n } N n=1 with its long-time limit. We use 2-norm to measure their difference</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">D(t) = N n=1 ( χt n -χ∞ n ) 2 . (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>From the numerical simulation, we plot D(t) for the system size N = 40 and H ranging from 1 to N , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3a</ref>. We observe that { χt n } N n=1 converges under time evolution roughly exponentially. Further, the decaying rate, which corresponds to the scrambling speed, varies for different initial Holevo information H.</p><p>To compare the speed of scrambling between 1 ≤ H ≤ N , we extract the average slope on the semi-log plot of D(t) between time t and t as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">k t,t D = log D(t) -log D(t ) t -t<label>(6)</label></formula><p>as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3b</ref>. The upper and lower confidence bounds are roughly estimated by the maximum and minimum slope in the region. For the same set of circuits, the scrambling rate slows down when an increasing amount of information is encoded into the system until close to H N ∼ 1 where the tendency reverses, which may be caused by the finite size effect.</p><p>We further study the information scrambling behavior of individual realizations U of random circuits by comparing the Holevo information distribution χ Q,Q H (U ) with the average value over different realizations. We characterize it by the standard deviation</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">σ t n σ t n 2 = 1 |U t | 1 |S n | 1 |S H | U ∈Ut Q∈Sn Q H ∈S H (χ Q,Q H (U )-χn ) 2 . (7)</formula><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3c</ref>, we numerically compute its long time limit σ ∞ n = lim t→∞ σ t n by setting t = 3N . The ratio N : H = 19 : 8 is set in accordance with Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. As we can see, σ ∞ n is asymptotically zero not only in the region n N &lt; 1 2 and n N &gt; N +H 2N , where χ∞ n already saturates, but also in the region 1  2 &lt; n N &lt; N +H 2N . This suggests that information almost fully scrambles even for a single typical random circuit.</p><p>Only at the two phase transition points can we get finite standard deviations, which do not increase with N , H and n so the relative fluctuation is decreasing for larger systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SIMILAR PHASE-TRANSITION-LIKE BEHAVIOR FOR COHERENT INFORMATION</head><p>After studying the information scrambling dynamics by the classical information, a natural next step is to consider if the same scrambling dynamics can be probed by quantum information as well, particularly if the same phase-transition-like behavior persists.</p><p>Coherent information <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> quantifies the remaining quantum information after a state goes through a quantum channel, with similar properties as the mutual information in classical communication. The coherent information is also related to the reversibility of the quantum channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and the condition of quantum error correction <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, thus lies at the heart of understanding the difference between classical and quantum information communication.</p><p>As shown in the inset of Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, similar to the model for Holevo information, we encode quantum information of C in N qubits with periodic boundary conditions, apply random Clifford circuit U ∈ U t and regard a randomly selected subsystem E as the environment to be traced off. The difference is that the system's initial state Q init would be an ensemble</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">ρ init = 1 2 C I Q C ⊗ |0...0 0...0| others ,</formula><p>where Q C represents a subsystem of randomly selected C qubits. This ensemble can be seen as a mixture of |ψ init i with equal probabilities. We write the final state of the n-qubit system Q as ρ Q . The circuit, together with tracing out the environment E, forms a quantum channel C. The coherent information can thus be calculated as <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_14">η Q (ρ init , C) = S(ρ Q ) -S(ρ, C),<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where S(ρ, C) is the entropy exchange. By definition, to calculate S(ρ, C), we need to purify Q init using a reference system R init before applying the quantum channel. Then we get S(ρ, C) = S(ρ QR ).</p><p>Similar to what we have done for Holevo information, we write η Q (ρ init , C) ≡ η Q,Q H (C) and average over the system Q, the input states and the circuit to get</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">ηt n = 1 |U t | 1 |S n | 1 |S C | U ∈Ut Q∈Sn Q H ∈S C η Q,Q H (C).<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Finally, the long-time limit η∞ n is approximated by t = 3N . The results for various system sizes are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> which has a phase-transition-like behavior similar to that of the Holevo information, although the phase transition points are at n N = N -C 2N , n N = N +C 2N . To see how these transition points correspond to those for the Holevo information, note that the second transition point n N = N +C 2N is the same for both cases. On the other hand, when n N &lt; N -C 2N , all the information goes into the environment, making the coherent information saturate to its lower bound </p><formula xml:id="formula_16">= N -C 2N , n N = N +C 2N</formula><p>, respectively. The inset shows an illustration of the numerical scheme. The initial state, encoded as an ensemble into Q init , is purified by R init . After a random circuit U ∈ Ut, part of the system E is traced out as the environment. Together they form a quantum channel C. The coherent information encoded in the system Q can thus be computed with the help of the reference system R.</p><p>transition point at n N = N -C 2N thus corresponds to that of the Holevo information in the environment E rather than in the system Q. Finally, when n &lt; N 2 we have negative η∞ n , indicating that no quantum information can be retrieved from the output system. This is in agreement with the result for Holevo information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. DISCUSSIONS</head><p>In summary, in this work we use the spatial distribution of Holevo information to characterize the information scrambling process. The information converges to zero in the thermodynamic limit when we consider subsystem sizes smaller than half the system. When exceeding this threshold, the extractable classical information increases by two bit per added qubit until its saturation to the total encoded information. This can serve as a scrambling criterion, and its comparison with others, including Haar scrambled <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and Page scrambled <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> criteria, is of great interest. We study how the system approaches the long-time limit and how the convergence speed varies with the amount of encoded information. We also find that variation around the average behavior is vanishingly small almost everywhere apart from the two phase transition points, which implies that in the thermodynamic limit, almost all random circuits would meet the scrambling criteria. Finally, we find that the coherent information possesses a similar phasetransition-like behavior.</p><p>One can regard the discarded environment in our model as the qubit loss error from the quantum error correction (QEC) perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. Thus the phase transition point n N = N +C 2N of coherent information would correspond to the condition of perfect decoding. Specifically, our model uses the random circuit to encode C logical qubits in N physical qubits. This code can tolerate the loss of N -C 2 located qubits which saturates the quantum Singleton bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</p><p>Although here we restrict the calculation to Clifford gates for numerical convenience, this method using Holevo information to characterize information scrambling should largely be applicable to generic quantum systems. Specifically, this process of encoding information by a set of initial states and calculating the Holevo information of a selected subsystem in the final states does not require any special property of the intermediate quantum dynamics. We can thus easily extend the unitary evolution to arbitrary quantum channels, although the detailed late time physics may depend on specific models and remains an open direction for future research. Therefore it may provide a universal tool for probing quantum information scrambling dynamics.</p></div>
