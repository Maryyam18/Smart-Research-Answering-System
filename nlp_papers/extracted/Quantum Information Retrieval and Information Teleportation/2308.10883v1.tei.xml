<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We consider both the classical and quantum variations of X-secure, E-eavesdropped and T -colluding symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR). This is the first work to study SPIR with X-security in classical or quantum variations. We first develop a scheme for classical X-secure, E-eavesdropped and T -colluding SPIR (XSETSPIR) based on a modified version of cross subspace alignment (CSA), which achieves a rate of R = 1 -X+max(T,E) N . The modified scheme achieves the same rate as the scheme used for X-secure PIR with the extra benefit of symmetric privacy. Next, we extend this scheme to its quantum counterpart based on the N -sum box abstraction. This is the first work to consider the presence of eavesdroppers in quantum private information retrieval (QPIR). In the quantum variation, the eavesdroppers have better access to information over the quantum channel compared to the classical channel due to the over-the-air decodability. To that end, we develop another scheme specialized to combat eavesdroppers over quantum channels. The scheme proposed for X-secure, E-eavesdropped and T -colluding quantum SPIR (XSETQSPIR) in this work maintains the super-dense coding gain from the shared entanglement between the databases, i.e., achieves a rate of RQ = min 1, 2 1 -X+max(T,E) N .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>In the private information retrieval (PIR) problem introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, a user wishes to retrieve a message out of K messages stored in N databases without revealing the index of the required message to any of the databases. The optimal rate of PIR with N databases and K replicated messages is shown to be C(N, K) = (1 + 1 N + . . . + 1 N K-1 ) -1 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Subsequently, several variations of this problem have been studied with different requirements for the databases and the user. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, symmetric PIR (SPIR) is introduced, where the user is not allowed to obtain any information about the message set other than the required message. The capacity of SPIR is shown to be 1 -1</p><p>N in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, which is also C(N, ∞). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, T -colluding PIR is introduced where any T databases can share the queries received from the user to learn the required message index. The capacity of T -colluding PIR is shown to be (1 + T N + . . . + T K-1 N K-1 ) -1 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, which is also C( N T , K). T -colluding SPIR is considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and its capacity is shown to be 1 -T N , which is C( N T , ∞). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the E-eavesdropped, T -colluding SPIR is introduced. In this setting, there is an eavesdropper that can listen to all answers from any E databases to the user. The capacity for this case is shown to be 1 -max(T,E) N in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The problem of X-secure PIR is introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, where the messages need to be hidden from the databases themselves even when X databases share their complete datasets. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the asymptotic capacity of Xsecure T -colluding PIR, i.e., the capacity when K → ∞, is shown to be 1 -X+T N . Some other variations of the PIR and SPIR problems have been studied and different applications have been introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9</ref>]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>The problem of quantum PIR (QPIR) is recently introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In this model, the message bits are sent over a quantum channel from the databases to the user, and the databases can share entanglement between them. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> shows that the capacity of symmetric QPIR (SQPIR) is 1 when the number of databases is N ≥ 2. Variations of QPIR include T -colluding QPIR with and without coded storage <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, QPIR with noisy channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and several other variations analogous to their classical counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Most recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> has proposed a mathematical abstraction for the entanglement between transmitters sending information to a common receiver over separate quantum channels. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> shows that the entanglement between N transmitters that use Pauli operators to encode classical messages to quantum states can be represented mathematically as a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) multiple access channel (MAC) with 2N inputs and N outputs, i.e., a matrix with N × 2N dimensions. In addition, this matrix must have elements from a finite field, and must satisfy the strong self orthogonal (SSO) property. Using these properties, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> shows that the rate of X-secure T -colluding QPIR for their proposed scheme is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R Q = min 1, 2 1 -X+T N . This is a doubling of the classical rate R C = 1 -X+T N in the regime of interest.</formula><p>In this paper, we focus on both classical and quantum variations of the SPIR problem with a passive eavesdropper which listens to queries and answers going into and out of any of the E databases. In addition, up to T databases collude, and up to X databases communicate. This is the first work that considers X-secure SPIR in general, even in the classical domain, and even without E-eavesdropped and Tcolluding databases. We show that the rate of the modified CSA scheme (modified for the symmetric privacy) R is the same as the rate of the CSA scheme proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> with the extra benefit of symmetric privacy, i.e., R = 1 -X+max(T,E) N . In addition, this is the first work to consider the presence of eavesdroppers in QPIR. We develop a QPIR scheme that maintains privacy and security against eavesdroppers, colluding databases and communicating databases. Our proposed quantum scheme achieves the maximum super-dense coding gain when an entangled state is shared between the databases, i.e., R Q = min 1, 2 1 -X+max(T,E) N . The QPIR problem with eavesdroppers is more complex compared to the classical PIR problem with eavesdroppers due to the over-theair decodability imposed by the N -sum box abstraction. The quantum scheme we propose in this work achieves double the rate of its classical counterpart.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>The system consists of N databases and a user who wants to retrieve a message.

The system contains K messages, W 1 , . . . , W K , of equal length L, that are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). The messages are generated uniformly at random from the field F q , with q = p r , where p is any prime number.

The user wants to retrieve a message W θ , where θ is chosen uniformly at random from [1 : K], and sends a query to each database (Q</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">[θ] 1 , . . . , Q [θ] N ) denoted by Q [θ] [1:N ] .</formula><p>As the user does not know the messages, the queries are generated independent of the message content,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">I(W [1:K] ; Q [θ] [1:N ] ) = 0, θ ∈ [1 : K].<label>(10)</label></formula><p>In addition, we require that the index of the retrieved message by the user is private against any T colluding databases,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">I(θ; Q [θ] T ) = 0, θ ∈ [1 : K],<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">T ⊂ [1 : N ], |T | ≤ T .</formula><p>Upon receiving the queries, the nth database replies with a deterministic answer string A</p></div>

The databases store S n , n ∈ [1 : N ], as classical bits and share an entangled state of N quantum bits denoted by ρ. The user sends the queries Q (ρ), where tr(•) is the trace operator, replies to the user queries over a separate quantum channel.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark 6</head><p>We explain the the main concept behind Theorem 3 as follows: If u and v are chosen such that H u N and H v N are dual QCSA matrices, then there exists an N -entangled qubit shared between the N databases such that the quantum channels between the databases and the user can be represented by G(u, v).</p><p>Remark 7 A main difference between the quantum channel and the classical channel is that the decoding is done over-theair. This implies that if the eavesdropper listens to E answers, there is a possibility that it can get up to E out of the L symbols. This means that the eavesdropper is more powerful in the quantum variation compared to the classical variation. Now, we are ready to describe the XSETQSPIR scheme. The storage at each database is slightly modified compared to the classical case. The storage in the quantum scheme S Q is given as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">S Q = [S n (1) t , S n (2) t ] t ,<label>(41)</label></formula><p>where S n (1) and S n (2) are as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>, i.e., each containing L = N -X -M ≤ N 2 new symbols of the K messages, along with new random noise vectors. In other words, the length of the messages considered in the quantum scheme is twice of what was considered in the classical case. To retrieve the required message, the user sends the query Q</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">[θ]</formula><p>n to database n, which is of the same form as in the classical scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. Each database n, n ∈ [1 : N ], then generates the noise added answers as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_53">Â[θ] n (1) = S n (1) t Q [θ] n + P n (1) (42) Â[θ] n (2) = S n (2) t Q [θ] n + P n (2)<label>(43)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">P n (1) = X+M-1 i=0 α i n Z ′ i (1), P n (2) = X+M-1 i=0 α i n Z ′ i (2) (44)</formula><p>with all Z ′ i (j) being random noise symbols. To prevent the eavesdropper from decoding over-the-air, the user sends two masking variables to each database n, given by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">Λ n (κ) = γ n 1 f 1 -α n λ 1 (κ) + . . . + 1 f L -α n λ L (κ) + λ L+1 (κ) + α n λ L+2 (κ) + . . . + α N -L-1 n λ N (κ) ,<label>(45)</label></formula><p>for κ ∈ <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, where λ n (κ), n ∈ [1 : N ], κ ∈ [1 : 2] are uniform independent random variables generated by the user.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we studied the classical and quantum variations of the X-secure, E-eavesdropped, and T -colluding symmetric PIR. In the classical variation, we developed a scheme that achieves symmetric privacy at the same rate as the state-of-the-art scheme that solves the same problem without symmetric privacy. In the quantum variation, we uncovered how the eavesdroppers have better access to the transmitted answer strings due to the over-the-air decodability imposed by the N -sum box abstraction. To that end, we designed a scheme that represses over-the-air decodability while maintaining the super-dense coding gain, i.e., doubling the rate compared to the classical variation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>N ] over a classical channel to each of the N databases, and each database n, n ∈ [1 : N ], with the quantum system A 0 n = tr j=[1:N ] j =n</figDesc></figure>
