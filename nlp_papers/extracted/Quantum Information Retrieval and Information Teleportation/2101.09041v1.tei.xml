<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Quantum private information retrieval (QPIR) for quantum messages is the protocol in which a user retrieves one of the multiple quantum states from one or multiple servers without revealing which state is retrieved. We consider QPIR in two different settings: the blind setting, in which the servers contain one copy of the message states, and the visible setting, in which the servers contain the description of the message states. One trivial solution in both settings is downloading all states from the servers and the main goal of this paper is to find more efficient QPIR protocols. First, we prove that the trivial solution is optimal for one-server QPIR in the blind setting. In one-round protocols, the same optimality holds even in the visible setting. On the other hand, when the user and the server share entanglement, we prove that there exists an efficient one-server QPIR protocol in the blind setting. Furthermore, in the visible setting, we prove that it is possible to construct symmetric QPIR protocols in which the user obtains no information of the non-targeted messages. We construct three two-server symmetric QPIR protocols for pure states. Note that symmetric classical PIR is impossible without shared randomness unknown to the user.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A. Backgrounds: Private information retrieval (PIR) for classical messages 1) Private information retrieval (PIR): Private information retrieval is a method to retrieve a message from a server without revealing which message is retrieved. PIR has a simple solution of downloading all messages and this trivial solution is proved to be optimal <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, i.e., the optimal communication complexity is O(m), where m is the total number of bits in the messages. To improve the communication efficiency of PIR, there have been mainly two approaches: PIR with computational assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and PIR with multiple servers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Recently, information-theoretic aspects of PIR has been extensively studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. In this paper, we only focus on the one-server and multi-server PIRs without computational assumptions.</p><p>Symmetric PIR (SPIR) is PIR in which the user obtains only the targeted message but no information of the non-targeted messages. In the one-server case, SPIR is also called oblivious transfer, which is proven to be impossible even in the quantum case <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In the multi-server case, Gertner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> proved that SPIR is impossible, but it becomes possible if the servers share randomness.</p><p>2) One-server quantum PIR for classical messages: PIR has also been studied when quantum communication is allowed between the user and the server(s) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Hereinafter, Server User 1. message states ρ 1 , . . . , ρ f 2. target index k ∈ [f]</p><p>5. retrieval ρ k 3. queries Q (1) , . . . , Q (r)   4. answers A (1) , . . . , A (r)   Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>: One-server QPIR protocol with quantum messages. At round i, the user uploads a query Q (i) and downloads an answer A (i) .</p><p>we denote quantum PIR for classical messages as C-QPIR. Interestingly, when the server is honest, i.e., the server does not deviate from the protocol, Le Gall <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed a C-QPIR protocol with communication complexity O( √ m), and Kerenidis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> improved this result by O(poly log m), where the communication in the quantum case is the total number of communicated qubits. However, when the server deviates from the protocol as far as its malicious operations are not revealed to the user, which is called specious adversary, Baumeler and Broadbent <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> proved that the communication complexity is at least O(m), i.e., the trivial solution of downloading all messages is optimal also for this case. When prior entanglement is allowed between the user and the server, the communication complexity is improved by O(log m) for the honest server model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, but the communication complexity is also lower bounded by O(m) for the specious attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>3) Multi-server quantum PIR for classical messages: For multi-server C-QPIR, Kerenidis and de Wolf <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> proposed a symmetric C-QPIR protocol without shared randomness. Song and Hayashi <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> derived symmetric and non-symmetric C-QPIR capacity, which is defined similar to its classical counterpart <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> as the optimal communication efficiency for arbitrary-long classical messages, and proved that symmetric C-QPIR can be constructed without any communication loss if prior-entanglement among servers is allowed. They <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and Allaix et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> also considered C-QPIR with colluding</p><p>TABLE I: Definition of symbols Symbol Definition m Total size of messages (states) f Number of messages (states) r Number of rounds in multi-round models n Number of servers in multi-server models</p><p>servers in which secrecy of the protocol is preserved even if some servers may communicate and collude. Kon and Lim <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> constructed a symmetric C-QPIR protocol with quantumkey distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Contribution: quantum PIR for quantum messages</head><p>Even if quantum PIR has been studied for classical messages, there has been no study of PIR for quantum messages, i.e., quantum states. This paper considers quantum PIR for quantum messages. Throughout this paper, we denote quantum PIR for quantum messages as QPIR. Downloading all quantum messages is also a trivial solution for QPIR. Intuitively, it seems reasonable to conjecture this trivial solution is optimal for QPIR. However, since the C-QPIR for the honest server has more efficient solutions than the trivial solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we cannot exclude the possibility of efficient one-server QPIR protocols. Furthermore, whereas the optimality proof of classical PIR <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> uses the communication transcript between the server and the user, we cannot apply the same technique because quantum states cannot be copied because of the nocloning theorem. Thus, the first goal is to answer whether the trivial solution is also optimal QPIR under several attack models and how we can construct more efficient protocols than the trivial solution. Furthermore, it is not unknown if symmetric QPIR (QSPIR) is possible on the multiple server model.</p><p>1) Two settings in QPIR: QPIR can be studied in two distinct settings, called the blind and visible settings, in which quantum state compression has also been extensively studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In the blind setting, the server(s) contains quantum systems X 1 , . . . , X f with the message states ρ 1 , . . . , ρ f , respectively, but does not know the states of the systems. Due to the no-cloning theorem, the server(s) cannot generate more copies of the message states and the server's operations are independent of the message states. QPIR in the blind setting is suitable for the case where the server(s) generates the message states by some quantum algorithm and performs the QPIR task.</p><p>On the other hand, in the visible setting, the server(s) contains the descriptions of the message states. With the descriptions of quantum states, the servers can generate multiple copies of the quantum states, without the limitation of the nocloning theorem, and apply quantum operations depending on the descriptions of the states. Since any protocol in the blind setting can be considered as a protocol in the visible setting, we can generally expect to achieve lower communication complexity in the visible setting. Even if the description of a quantum state is classical information, it is infinitelength classical information, and therefore we cannot send this description via QPIR for classical messages. Furthermore, the visible setting is a reasonable setting for the case where the user has no ability to generate quantum states and requires the generation of the targeted state along with the QPIR task.</p><p>2) Optimality of trivial solution for one-server QPIR: Our first result is that the trivial solution is optimal for one-server QPIR for the honest server model. For the one-server case, the comparison of the our results and previous results are summarized in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>. We first prove for the one-round case and then extend the result to the multi-round case. In the oneround case, we prove the optimality both for blind and visible settings, but in the multi-round case, we only prove for the blind setting. The entropic inequalities are the key instruments for the proof, and we prove and use a chain rule for the multi-round case. Since the honest server model is the weakest attack model, this result implies that the trivial solution is also optimal for any attack models.</p><p>3) One-server QPIR protocol with prior entanglement in blind setting: Secondly, with prior entanglement between the user and the server, we prove that there exists an efficient QPIR protocol on the honest server model. To be precise, we propose a method to construct a QPIR protocol of communication complexity O(f (m)) with prior entanglement from C-QPIR protocol of communication complexity O(f (m)) with prior entanglement. We construct the QPIR protocol by the combination of C-QPIR and quantum teleportation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. The proposed QPIR protocol inherits the security of C-QPIR. With this property, on the honest server model with prior entanglement, there exists a QPIR protocol of communication complexity O(log m) since there exist C-QPIR protocols of communication complexity O(log m) by Kerenidis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>4) Two-server QSPIR protocols for pure states in visible setting: Lastly, we prove that QSPIR is possible in the visible setting. We propose two-server QSPIR protocols for pure states in the visible setting, and the protocols work for the different classes of states. The first protocol is for pure qubit states. This protocol succeeds with probability and requires 8qubit average communication and 4-ebit average entanglement between servers (or 16-qubit communication without shared entanglement). The second protocol is for pure qudit states, where a qudit means a quantum d-level system. This protocol also succeeds with probability and requires 4d d log dqubit average communication and 2d d log d-ebit average entanglement between servers (or 8d d log d-qubit communication without shared entanglement). The last protocol is for pure states |U⟫ = s,t u st |s |t described by commutative unitary matrices U = s,t u st |s t| on qudits. This protocol succeeds deterministically with 4 log d-qubit communication and 2 log d ebits (or 8 log d-qubit communication without shared entanglement).</p><p>The QSPIR protocols have the following important properties. First, the protocols delegate most of the quantum information processing to the servers. All queries of the user are classical and the only quantum resource required for the user is a measurement apparatus for a fixed basis. Second, the average quantum communication complexities of these</p><p>TABLE II: Optimal communication complexity of one-server QPIR (a) One-server QPIR Messages Server Model Optimal communication complexity Ref. Classical Honest O(poly log m) [14] Classical Specious Θ(m) [12] Quantum (blind) Honest Θ(m) [This paper] Quantum (visible) Honest Θ(m) (for one-round) [This paper] (b) One-server QPIR with prior entanglement Messages Server Model Optimal communication complexity Ref. Classical Honest O(log m) [14] Classical Specious Θ(m) [15] Quantum (blind/visible) Honest O(log m) [This paper] (m: Total size of messages)</p><p>protocols do not scale with the number of message states. On the other hand, as a trade-off, the size of the queries scales linearly with the number of message states. The idea of our QSPIR protocols is explained as follows. In the visible setting, we can prepare the message states |ψ ℓ by the state preparation unitaries U ℓ such that U ℓ |0 = |ψ ℓ . We can decompose any state preparation unitaries U ℓ on qudits by phase-shift operations and rotation operations, which are described classically by 2(d -1) angles. Then, with the query structure of classical PIR, the servers collectively encode the phase-shift operations and the rotation operations composing U k into the maximally entangled states, where k is the index of the targeted message state |ψ k . By the query structure of classical PIR, this encoding process can be accomplished without leaking k to each server. The user receives the maximally entangled states encoded with the phase-shift operations and the rotation operations, and finally recovers the targeted message state |ψ k by the entanglement-swapping. The QSPIR protocol for qubit states is done more efficiently since only one rotation operation is necessary for decomposing U ℓ . For qudit states for d ≥ 3, the rotation operations for decomposing U ℓ are non-commutative and this non-commutativity leads to the increased complexity.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II is the preliminaries of the paper. Section III derives the lower bound of the communication complexity for oneserver QPIR. In the blind setting, Section IV proposes an efficient one-server QPIR protocol with prior entanglement. Section V proposes an efficient QPIR protocol in the visible setting. Section VI is the conclusion of the paper.</p></div>

The von Neumann entropy is defined as H(X) = H(ρ X ) = Tr ρ X log ρ X , where ρ X is the state on the quantum system X.</p><p>Proposition 1. The von Neumann entropy satisfies the following properties. (a) H(X) = H(Y ) if the state on X ⊗ Y is a pure state, (b) H(XY ) = H(X) + H(Y ) for product states on X ⊗ Y , (c) Entropy does not change by unitary operations, (d) H(XY ) + H(X) ≥ H(Y ), (e) H( s p s ρ s ) = s p s (H(ρ s ) -log p s ) if Tr ρ s ρ t = 0 for any s = t. The property (d) is proved as follows. Let Z be the reference system in which the state on XY Z is pure. Then, H(XY ) + H(X) = H(Z) + H(X) ≥ H(XZ) = H(Y ). Throughout the paper, we use the symbols (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) to denote which property is used, e.g., (a) = means that the equality holds from the property (a). Proposition 2. Consider two quantum systems A and B. If any pure states ρ AB and ρ ′ AB satisfy ρ A = ρ ′ A , there exists a unitary U B on B such that ρ AB = (I A ⊗ U B )ρ ′ AB (I A ⊗ U * B ). Proof. Diagonalize ρ A = s p s |s s|. When ρ AB = |ψ AB ψ AB | and ρ ′ AB = |ψ ′ AB ψ ′ AB |, we have |ψ AB = s p s |s, f (s) and |ψ ′ AB = s p s |s, g(s) , where {|f (s) } and {|g(s) } are sets of orthonormal vectors of B. Thus, U B = s |f (s) g(s)| is the desired unitary.

OPTIMALITY OF TRIVIAL PROTOCOL FOR ONE-SERVER QPIR</head><p>In this section, we prove that the trivial solution of downloading all messages is optimal for the one-server QPIR in two cases.

Optimality of trivial protocol for one-server one-round QPIR</head><p>In this subsection, we prove that the optimal communication complexity for one-server one-round QPIR is m, where m is the total number of qubits in the message states. The achievability part is proved by the trivial solution, which can be implemented in the blind setting, and we will prove the tight lower bound in the visible setting. Since any protocol in the blind setting can be regarded as a protocol in the visible setting, our tight lower bound in the visible setting proves that the trivial solution is optimal for both blind and visible settings.</p><p>We formally describe one-server one-round QPIR protocols in the visible setting with Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref> as follows.

The user chooses the index of the targeted message K ∈ [f], i.e., ρ k is the targeted quantum state when K = k. We assume that the user and the server contain local quantum registers, respectively, so that all local operations are written as unitary operations. A QPIR protocol Φ is described by three unitary maps (D (0) , D (1) , E (1) ) in the following steps. 1) Query: When K = k, the user prepares the initial state as 1) , and sends Q (1) to the server. 2) Answer: The server prepares the initial state |0 ∈ S (0) , applies a unitary map E (1) [ρ] from S (0) ⊗ Q (1) to A (1) ⊗ S (1) , and returns to the user the system A (1) . 3) Reconstruction: The user applies a unitary map D (1) from A (1) ⊗ T (1) to Y ⊗ E, and outputs the state on Y as the protocol output.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">|k ⊗ |0 ∈ A (0) ⊗ T (0) , applies a unitary map D (0) from A (0) ⊗ T (0) to Q (1) ⊗ T (</formula><p>The input-output relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Λ Φ (k, ρ) of the QPIR protocol Φ is written with a CPTP Γ Φ,ρ as Λ Φ (k, ρ) = Γ Φ,ρ (|k k|) = Tr S (1) ,E D (1) • E (1) [ρ] • D (0) (|k k| ⊗ |0 0|).</formula><p>The QPIR protocol Φ should satisfy the following conditions.</p><p>• Correctness: When the output state on Y with the target index</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">K = k is denoted by ρ k Y , the correctness is ρ k Y = ρ k<label>(9)</label></formula><p>for any k and any message states ρ.</p><p>• User secrecy: When the state on Q (1) with the target index</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">K = k is denoted by ρ k Q (1)</formula><p>, the user secrecy is</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">ρ k Q (1) = ρ ℓ Q (1)<label>(10)</label></formula><p>for any k, ℓ.</p><p>We evaluate the efficiency of a QPIR protocol Φ by the communication complexity CC(Φ) := log |Q (1) | + log |A (1) |, which is the whole dimension of uploaded and downloaded systems.

The protocol satisfying Theorem 3 is a simple combination of quantum teleportation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and any C-QPIR protocol.

TWO-SERVER SYMMETRIC QPIR PROTOCOLS IN VISIBLE SETTING In this section, we propose two-server one-round QSPIR protocols with classical query in the visible setting. In the multi-server model, the servers cannot communicate with each other. In the visible setting, the server has the description of quantum states instead of the states. With a description of a state ρ, the server may generate multiple copies of ρ, without limitation of the no-cloning theorem, and apply quantum operations depending on the description of ρ. Our protocols in this section are symmetric QPIR (QSPIR) in which the user only obtains the information of the targeted message state. Thus, our protocols prove that the QSPIR is possible in the visible setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Definition and main theorems</head><p>We propose three QSPIR protocols in the visible setting for pure states. The communication complexity of the protocols are summarized in Table <ref type="table">III</ref>. Even if the QPIR's trivial solution of downloading all states is not a QSPIR protocol, we can evaluate the efficiency of our QSPIR protocols by comparison with the communication complexities of the QPIR's trivial solution. Compared to the communication complexity of the QPIR's trivial solution is f log d qubits, the quantum communication complexities of our protocols do not scale with the number of messages f but scale with the dimension of the systems in which the message states are prepared. Thus, when the number of messages f is sufficiently greater than the dimension, the proposed protocols are more efficient than the QPIR's trivial solution of downloading all messages.</p><p>Our QSPIR protocols are included in the class of n-server QSPIR protocols in the visible setting with the classical queries described as follows. Let P(C d ) be the set of pure states in C d . We formally define a QSPIR protocol Φ for P ⊂ P(C d ). The message states are given as arbitrary f states ψ = (|ψ 1 , . . . , |ψ f ) ∈ P f and each server has the descriptions of all messages states. The user chooses the index of the targeted message K ∈ [f], i.e., |ψ k is the targeted quantum state when K = k.

Our protocols will be defined for n = 2 servers with the maximally entanglement states as the prior entanglement. The prior entanglement can be replaced by user's upload of the entangled states. However, we state our results with the prior entanglement because the entangled states can be prepared without any user's operation.</p><p>We prove the following two theorems. The protocols for pure states are constructed by the following idea. Any pure state is written as U|0 with unitary matrices U which are decomposed by rotation operations and phase-shift operations. With this fact, the user requests the servers to apply certain rotation operations and phase-shift operations on bipartite entangled states so that the user can recover the targeted pure state after receiving the entangled state. To guarantee the user secrecy, we import to our protocols the same query structure of two-server classical PIR protocol by Chor et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>We denote by U(C d ) the unitary group on C d and define the set of pure states associated with U(C d ) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_65">S(C d ) = |U⟫ | U ∈ U(C d ) .

Since the measurement outcome is 0 with probability 1/d, the expected number of trials is d. Thus, the average communication complexity is cd.</p><p>We also construct a QSPIR protocol for pure states represented by commutative unitary matrices.  In the following subsections, we construct the QSPIR protocols to achieve the communication complexity of Theorems 4, 5, 6. Since the protocol for Theorem 6 is the most simplest and the similar idea is used in the other two protocols, we will first construct the protocol for Theorem 6 and then the other two protocols.</p></div>

Thus, the average quantum communication complexity is 8 qubits, and the average size of entanglement is 4 ebits. If we replace the prior entanglement by the transmission of |I 2 ⟫ ⊗ |I 2 ⟫ from the user to the servers, the average communication complexity is 2f bits and 16 qubits. Compared to the QPIR's trivial solution of downloading all quantum messages, which requires the communication of f qubits, the above protocol has less quantum communication on average when f &gt; 16 even if ebits are uploaded by the user. On the other hand, our protocol requires classical communication of 2f bits.</p></div>

Both Protocols 3 and 4 can be applied for QPIR of qubit states. However, the average communication complexity of Protocol 3, which is 8 qubits and 4 ebits, is less than that of Protocol 4 for d = 2, which is 16 qubits and 8 edits. The advantage of Protocol 3 comes from the commutation relation between the rotation operations R(θ) and Y = XZ = R(π/2). Since the reduced state after the Bell measurement is represented with Y, Z as (72) and Y is commutative with R(θ) for any θ, the user can reconstruct the targeted state efficiently as (73). On the other hand, the similar method cannot be applied for Protocol 4 because the rotation operations R(θ) for d &gt; 2 are not commutative with any multiplication of X d and Z d . Thus, without using the commutative relation, Protocol 4 for d = 2 results in greater communication complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>We have studied quantum private information retrieval for quantum messages in the blind and visible settings. We have proved that the trivial solution of downloading all messages is optimal for honest one-server QPIR, which is a similar result to the classical PIR but different from QPIR for classical messages. In the one-round case, the optimality is proved for both blind and visible settings, and in the multi-round case, it is proved for the blind setting. On the other hand, we have constructed efficient QPIR protocols with two cases. The first case is one-server QPIR with prior entanglement in the blind setting. We have constructed a reduction from any QPIR protocol for classical messages to a QPIR protocol for quantum messages and derived an efficient QPIR protocol from the protocol by Kerenidis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The second case is multi-server QSPIR in the visible setting. We have constructed three protocols for pure qubit states, pure qudit states, and pure states described by commutative unitaries. These protocols in the visible setting are symmetric QPIR protocols in which the user obtains no information other than the targeted message state. Thus, we proved that QSPIR is possible for quantum messages. Furthermore, these protocols are also more efficient than the QPIR's trivial solution when the number of messages are sufficiently greater than the dimension of quantum systems.</p><p>There are many open problems related to the study of QPIR for quantum messages. Our optimality proof of the trivial one-server QPIR protocol is for the one-round visible setting and the multi-round blind setting. It is unknown whether the optimality still applies for the multi-round one-server visible setting and the multi-server blind setting. Also, we have only considered QPIR with information-theoretic security. Our result does not preclude the possibility of the non-trivial oneserver QPIR protocol with computational security. Furthermore, even if our QSPIR protocol for qudits is more efficient than the QPIR's trivial solution when the number of message states f is sufficiently large, the average communication complexity increases exponentially with the dimension d of the system. In addition, our QSPIR protocols are for pure states and it cannot be directly extended to protocols for the mixed state. Thus, more efficient QSPIR protocols for qudits and QSPIR for mixed states are also open problems. Interesting applications of our QSPIR protocols can also be considered for other communication and computation problems. We leave these questions for interested readers.</p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><head>•</head><figDesc>Correctness: As described in Step 4, the user recovers |ψ k with positive probability by repeating until success. • Secrecy: This protocol satisfies the user secrecy, because the queries are the same as Protocol 3 and the number of requests in Step 4. Step 4-d is necessary since the states in (83) and (84) should be requested the same number of times. This protocol also satisfies the server secrecy, because the only information that the user obtains from the servers is states in (83) and (84) and these states only depend on the state |ψ k . • Communication complexity: At Step 1, the size of queries is 2f bits. For downloading all states (83), 2d log dqubit communication and d log d-ebit are required. The probability to succeed to generate the state in (87) is 1/d d-1 and therefore, the expected number of execution of Steps from 4-a to 4-c is d d-1 . Thus, for finishing Steps from 4-a to 4-c, the average quantum communication is less than 2d d log d = d d-1 •2d log d qubits and the average shared entanglement is less than d d log d = d d-1 • d log d ebits. Similarly, for Step 4-d, the same average quantum communication and the same average shared entanglement are required. Thus, Protocol 4 requires 2f-bit classical communication, 4d d log d-qubit average quantum communication, and 2d d log d-ebit average prior entanglement. The communication complexity of Protocol 4 does not scale with the number of message states f. Since the QPIR's trivial solution of downloading all messages requires f log dqubit quantum communication, Protocol 4 is more efficient on average if the number of messages f is greater than 4d d .
