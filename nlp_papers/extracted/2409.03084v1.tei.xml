<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Efficient control schemes that enable fast, high-fidelity operations are essential for any practical quantum computation. However, current optimization protocols are intractable due to stringent requirements imposed by the microscopic systems encoding the qubit, including dense energy level spectra and cross talk, and generally require a trade-off between speed and fidelity of the operation. Here, we address these challenges by developing a general framework for optimal control based on the quantum metric tensor. This framework allows for fast and high-fidelity adiabatic pulses, even for a dense energy spectrum, based solely on the Hamiltonian of the system instead of the full time evolution propagator and independent of the size of the underlying Hilbert space. Furthermore, the framework suppresses diabatic transitions and state-dependent crosstalk effects without the need for additional control fields. As an example, we study the adiabatic charge transfer in a double quantum dot to find optimal control pulses with improved performance. We show that for the geometric protocol, the transfer fidelites are lower bounded F &gt; 99 % for ultrafast 20 ns pulses, regardless of the size of the anti-crossing.</p></div>

INTRODUCTION</head><p>Coherent control of quantum information is the central part of the advancement of emerging quantum technologies such as quantum processors, quantum sensors, and quantum communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, the inherently fragile nature of quantum states makes their coherent control a challenging task. Much research is dedicated to finding so-called quantum optimal control protocols, that allow fast and high-fidelity operations by appropriately shaping the control pulses <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Optimized initialization and readout protocols are of particular interest, as they are an integral part of any error correction algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>To achieve a fast and high-fidelity protocol, one has to carefully compose pulse shapes to avoid undesired transitions, which are summarized in shortcut-to-adiabaticity methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Through the addition of new control fields, one can suppress these transitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. However, this approach requires additional experimental overhead and precise control of new driving parameters. Approximate methods, based on the minimization of diabatic transitions, circumvent new control fields and only affect the experimentally accessible parameters while providing fast and quasiadabatic (fast-QUAD) protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Unfortunately, these methods cannot be straightforwardly generalized to bigger parameter spaces and beyond transitions between two energy levels. Most protocols are based on classical optimization problems, which are computationally challenging for larger systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and hence make purely numerical methods unattractive. Geometric approaches, including the space curve quantum control <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, allow for a simple geometric understanding of noisy time dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Notwithstanding, this geometric picture is limited because it relies on the computation of the time evolution operator and is hence constrained to small system sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. In addition, the derived pulse shapes are natively discontinuous due to the closed-curve and closed-area constraints of the formalism. Similar constraints on the control field to suppress first-, and second-order errors can also be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we develop a general geometric approach to provide a general framework, based on geodesics provided by the quantum metric tensor <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, that can be generalized to any multi-level Hamiltonian and allows for fast and high-fidelity adiabatic operations. We refer to this approach as the geometric fast-QUAD. Our geometric fast-QUAD does not require imposing any new external control fields like in the counter-diabatic approach, it is resistant to miscalibration errors and allows for fast operations even in dense energy landscapes. It reduces undesired level transitions and the state-dependent crosstalk in the qubit operation and initialization/readout phases. In addition, since it does not require the computation of the full time-ordered evolution operator, we can easily adjust it to allow for operational flexibility of different quantum platforms. We show the advantages of the geometric fast-QUAD through an optimal protocol for initialization and readout of semiconductor spin-qubits.</p><p>Semiconductor spin qubits are a platform for quantum computing based on confined semiconductor quantum dots with a promise to be scalable <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>, with long coherence times <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, operability at high temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>, and their similarity in fabrication to the classical semiconductor industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. However, their small size can lead to dense energy spectra that may hinder fast and high-fidelity quantum control. For reading out and initializing such qubits, the measured signal is typically enhanced through spin-to-charge conversion techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. Common spin-to-charge techniques, such as Pauli-Spin-Blockade (PSB), rely on an adiabatic transition between a spin and a charge state <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> passing through multiple anticrossings. We illustrate advantages of the geometric fast-QUAD through optimizing the PSB initialization and readout in a double quantum dot (DQD) with experimentally feasible parameters.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows.

The quantum metric</head><p>Optimal control schemes rely on the control of parameters x µ = (x 1 , x 2 . . . , x n ) of the physical Hamiltonian to provide high-fidelity state transfer. The task of optimizing the fidelity of state transfer can be captured in the geometric structure of the Hilbert space through the quantum metric tensor <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Minimal energy fluctuations and geodesic equations</head><p>The quantum metric tensor g µν allows us now to connect fast and quasi-adiabatic (fast-QUAD) dynamics with the geometry of the parameter space. For coherent population transfer, experimentally controlled parameters can be written as x µ (t). State transfer is then given by a path connecting the set of initial parameter values x µ i ≡ x µ (0) to some final set x µ f ≡ x µ (t f ). The task of fast and high-fidelity population transfer then relates to the optimization problem of finding an optimal path x µ geo (t) between these two points described by the following functional</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L[x, ẋ, t] = t f 0 dt g µν (x) dx µ dt dx ν dt .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>This functional describes the length of a path x µ (t) parametrized by time t and can be minimized for -p(t f ) via quantum geometric protocols for a single qubit system (8) as a function of pulse time t f . As the quantum metric tensor ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">9</ref>) is independent of ϕ we can choose a protocol exclusively for ρ(t) or for the ratio θ(t) = arctan2(ρ(t), z(t)).</p><p>Using the quantum adiabatic protocol (4) we find analytically that θgeo(t) = (θ f -θ0) t/t f + θ0, where the adiabaticity is given by the ramp rate δ = (θ f -θ0)/t f . We also simulate the pulse numerically, as indicated by ρgeo(t). Remarkably, the two methods align even up to the minimum transfer error. Throughout these simulations the values of ϕ = 0, ρ0 = -10 GHz, ρ f = 10 GHz, z = 0.1 GHz have been used. Note that the precision of the numerical simulations determines the singular behavior (gray area) in the transfer error.</p><p>functions x µ geo (t) (See Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) that solve the Euler-Lagrange equations, which in this context are known as the geodesic equations.

Since the above relationship minimizes the local infidelity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, the geodesics also minimize the energy fluctuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> σ</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">2 E = Ĥ2 -Ĥ 2 ≈ g µν (x) dx µ dt dx ν dt (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>motivating the name of the adiabaticity δ = σ 2 E .

The above equation also converges to the quantum speed limit bound for pure states as found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, this allows us to draw a connection between adiabatic dynamics and geometry. To find an optimal time evolution of ε(t), we need to solve</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">g εε ε2 = n̸ =0 | ⟨ψ 0 |∂ ε Ĥ|ψ n ⟩ | 2 (E n -E 0 ) 2 dε dt 2 = δ 2 .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Unsurprisingly, this is similar to the known fast-QUAD equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, differing from the historical fast-QUAD equation only by an additional exponent of 2 of the energy splitting in the denominator <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. In contrast, however, it allows for a clear extension to multiple energy levels. In the remainder of the article, we refer to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">7</ref>) as geometric fast-QUAD equation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Two-level system</head><p>The geometric structure of Hilbert space allows us to optimize adiabatic population transfer. For instance, a two-level Hamiltonian in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, ϕ, z)</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ĤPauli = z ρ e -iϕ ρ e iϕ -z ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>leads to the quantum metric tensor resembling the Bloch sphere (see Appendix A)</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">[g µν (θ, ϕ)] = 1 4 1 0 0 sin 2 θ .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Here θ = arctan2(ρ, z) describes the azimuthal angle of the Bloch sphere. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows the simulated probability p(t f ) = | ⟨ψ 0 (t f )|ψ(t f )⟩ | 2 under adiabatic evolution for the standard linear protocol ρ linear (t) = (ρ fρ 0 ) t/t f + ρ 0 and the geometric protocol as defined in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>). Using the quantum adiabatic protocol (4) we find analytically that <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_11">θ geo (t) = (θ f -θ 0 ) t/t f + θ 0 ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where θ 0 , θ f are the initial and final values of θ(t). Remarkably, our analytic expression θ geo (t) and the fully numerically simulated pulse ρ geo (t) cannot be distinguished. In both cases, because of the minimization of the energy fluctuations, the transfer errors arising from undesired diabatic transitions are drastically reduced with respect to the linear protocol. The geometric fast-QUAD can be easily extended to an arbitrary multi-level system as illustrated in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>). In addition, the quantum metric tensor only scales with the number of control parameters and is hence also useful for large systems, making it a reliable tool for analyzing and optimizing large-scale quantum architectures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. APPLICATION: CHARGE TRANSFER IN A DOUBLE QUANTUM DOT</head><p>Given the advantages of the quantum metric tensor, we aim to apply the geometric fast-QUAD for the adiabatic initialization and readout processes. We model an effective model for a double quantum dot (DQD) system that may be used directly for the initialization and readout of singlet-triplet qubits <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. After providing a brief overview of the microscopic model in III A, we investigate a truncated two-level model of the full model in Sec. III B, to extend the previous result of a two-level Landau-Zener problem to one in the presence of ST - coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>. Following, in Sec. III C, we will introduce a low-dimensional effective DQD model, which captures the spin-to-charge transition, while taking into account the spin state. Using this model, we will aim to provide a detailed analysis and comparison of the geometric fast-QUAD with the linear protocol under coherent and non-unitary noise. In the remaining text, we will work in units of ℏ.</p></div>

The indices a, b = x, y, z run over the spatial components. Additionally, we define E a = E a,1 + E a,2 and ∆E a = E a,1 -E a,2 as the total Zeeman energy and the Zeeman splitting difference, which may arise due to a spatially varying g-factor as usually found in germanium-based platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> or a magnetic field gradient as appears in silicon-based architectures with an additional micromagnet <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. The matrix representation in the full basis is given in Appendix B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Truncated two-level model</head><p>Here, we restrict our optimization protocol to suppress only the transition of the ground state to the closest state. This way we effectively work in a low-energy twodimensional subspace of the full 6x6 DQD, which in the eigenbasis takes the schematic form</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">ĤDQD ≈ n,m=0,1 H n,m |ψ n ⟩⟨ψ m | .

Due to the small ST -anti-crossing, as found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> for out-of-plane magnetic fields, we again find that the geometric fast-QUAD is superior to the linear pulse (See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Even under this simplification, we report a transfer fidelity of &gt; 99.99 % after around 150 ns pulse time.</p></div>

The size of the anti-crossing is now determined by the combination of the tunnel coupling Ω and the Zeeman splitting difference ∆E Z . In contrast to the Landau-Zener-Majorana-Stueckelberg anticross-ing, the energy spectrum is not symmetric in the detuning ε. Also, the existence of a third energy level, makes it possible for diabatic transitions from the ground state to two upper energy eigenstates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Incoherent dynamics</head><p>During coherent spin-to-charge conversion, a dominant error source are diabatic transitions in the vicinity of the anti-crossings, where the energy level difference is minimal. Our geometric protocol Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>) is designed to minimize such errors. However, non-unitary dynamics arise due to couplings with ambient degrees of freedom, which alter the time evolution and hence may affect the optimal pulse shape. In the following, we will describe two ubiquitous noise types that may affect the protocol, lowand high-frequency charge noise.</p><p>One of the most known types of noise in semiconducting and superconducting devices is the appearance of lowfrequency noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, whose noise spectral density follows S(f ) ∝ 1/f . Under sufficient conditions, the noise spectral density is the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation of the noise. For the Hamiltonian in Eq.

Since for spin qubits relaxation is several orders of magnitude longer than dephasing for spin <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and charge qubits <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, we neglect it in our analysis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Results</head><p>For concreteness, we will focus in our analysis only on the initialization process, as the readout process is directly provided by the reverse pulse shape. The initial state is the singlet state in the (2,0) charge state and is adiabatically pulsed to the desired final state. Under coherent evolution, the only error source is due to undesired diabatic transitions, inducing interference effects that reduce the transfer fidelity. We scan multiple pairs of parameters and simulate the transfer error 1p(t f ) using the protocol in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">7</ref>) and the linear protocol. For the geometric protocol, we generate an appropriate adiabaticity using the boundary conditions of the detuning (ε 0 , ε f ) and the pulse time t f with Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">6</ref>) and then feed the numerically solved pulse ε num (t) into our Hamiltonian or Lindbladian based time evolution, depending on whether we want to study unitary or non-unitary dynamics.</p><p>a. Unitary dynamics Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> shows the results of the geometric pulse for the initialization sequence of the |↓↑⟩ state of the Hamiltonian <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. The transfer error is reduced as a function of the pulse time as we move more adiabatic at larger pulse times. We observe the advantage of using the geometric fast-QUAD over the linear protocol as a reliable protocol for circumventing coherent errors, even for very small anti-crossings and extremely fast pulse times. Strikingly, we observe as a common trend, that the transfer fidelity for the geometric fast-QUAD for t f &gt; 20 ns yields a transfer fidelity F &gt; 99 % for all investigated settings of tunnel couplings Ω and Zeeman splitting differences ∆E Z . Note that these results, for the same parameter settings besides the detuning boundary conditions, also hold for the adiabatic readout protocol, as the energy is conserved along these paths.</p><p>b. Non-unitary dynamics In addition to providing higher fidelities for very short pulse times and dense energy spectra, our protocol is also highly resilient against quasistatic noise as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, where we plotted the susceptibility of the transfer fidelity with respect to detuning fluctuations. Notably, after 20 ns the effects of the quasistatic noise affect the fidelities below 10 -4 , even for strong fluctuation of δε = 5 GHz. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref> we also show that the geometric protocol is robust against pulse miscalibration regarding Ω → Ω + δΩ, for small δΩ and for pulse times bigger than 20 ns. Remarkably, assuming larger tunnel couplings for the pulse leads to smaller deviations from the calibrated result. This may be caused due to favorable interference effects in the initial ramp towards the anti-crossing. Namely, assuming a smaller anti-crossing will usually result in an initial fast ramp- A similar trend can be seen in (e), (f ). Remarkably, in (f ) the charge transfer fidelity is lower bounded at 99 %, independent of the combination (∆EZ , Ω) for an ultrafast pulse with pulse time t f = 20 ns. In addition, due to the conservation of energy along adiabatic paths, we observe no difference between the initialization and readout protocols. FIG. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Susceptibility of the geometric fast-QUAD to lowfrequency fluctuations in detuning. We simulate the effects of quasistatic noise via a fluctuation in the detuning <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. This fluctuation will affect the initial and final boundary conditions when simulating the pulse shape as follows: ε 0,f → ε 0,f + δε. We fix the values of the tunnel coupling to Ω = 3 GHz, ∆EZ = 0.5 GHz, and the remaining are identical to the ones in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>. The errors mostly affect infidelities below 1-F &lt; 10 -4 after a pulse time of t f = 20 ns. The asymmetry of the deviation is due to the fact that the energy spectrum is asymmetric around the anti-crossing at ε = Ũ .  ing ending in a slow-down at the anti-crossing, leading to interference effects that do not destructively interfere beyond the anti-crossing.</p><p>Lastly, we compare the optimal control sequences of the linear and geometric protocol given some fixed decoherence time T 2 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>. Here, we compute the linear and geometric fast-QUAD pulse shapes and simulate the Uhlmann fidelity of the lowest energy eigenstate |ψ 0 (t f )⟩ and the resulting mixed density matrix ρ(t f ) under Lindbladian time evolution. For a fixed interval of allowed pulse operation times t f ≤ 50 ns, we find the maximum Uhlmann fidelity at fixed decoherence time and compare the linear and geometric protocol. The maximum Uhlmann fidelity F(t * f ) is given by the optimal pulse operation time t * f for any given decoherence time T 2 . The linear protocol will always perform best at the longest allowed pulse times to suppress the diabatic transitions which dominate in this regime. On the other hand, the geometric fast-QUAD will be optimal at ultrafast operation times (t * f &lt; 10 ns) to simultaneousely reduce the coherent and incoherent errors through dephasing. Therefore, the geometric fast-QUAD will always outperform the linear protocol under fixed decoherence rates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this work, we established a relationship between the quantum geometric structure of the Hilbert space and quasiadiabatic time dynamics. Our main focus lied in providing a general framework to deal with coherent errors arising from undesired diabatic transitions between multiple energy levels while operating at fast pulse times. Special emphasis was put on applying these methods to enable fast and high-fidelity adiabatic initialization and readout for a DQD system, which is integral for the min-imization of state-dependent crosstalk. Nevertheless, we stress that the framework is applicable to all quantum systems with non-degenerate eigenvalues and only requires optimization on the level of the Hamiltonian and not the time-ordered evolution operator. For coherent evolution, we found that independent of the parameter configuration, the geometric fast-QUAD provides an upper bound on the transfer error at 10 -2 for pulse times of 20 ns. Miscalibration of the pulse and quasistatic noise did not yield significant deviations. Errors arising due to dephasing effects were studied, and it was found that the geometric fast-QUAD was always superior to the linear protocol with respect to the Uhlmann fidelity, while allowing ultrafast operation times.</p><p>Nevertheless, further efforts in the understanding of the quantum geometric approach have to be made, especially with a focus on including the effects of noise directly into the formalism, understanding the geometric difference between pure and mixed states, and what the impact of a non-abelian connection and degenerate eigenstates would be for transfer protocols. So far, the case of mixed states has been tackled only for full and finite rank density matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>, making it challenging to capture non-unitary time evolution and systems with infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Nevertheless, the quantum geometry of parameter space will provide new opportunities for ultrafast adiabatic operations allowing for significant improvements in the coherent processing of quantum information, accelerating the advancement of emerging quantum technologies.</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">[g µν (ρ, ϕ)] = 1 4(1 + ρ 2 ) 1 (1+ρ 2 ) 0 0 ρ 2 , (A6)</formula><p>which captures the fact that the embedding is welldefined.

These are shown in the figure as blue circles/red stars for two exemplary decoherence times T 2 = 1, 100 ns, respectively. Note that the geometric protocol provides a higher fidelity at shorter pulse times. From each simulation, therefore, we extract the fidelity F(t * f ), the pulse time t * f at which the highest fidelity is reached and the corresponding decoherence time T 2 . We note that, due to the small anti-crossing and the ultrafast pulse time (t f = 10 ns), the geometric pulse severely outperforms the linear protocol. However, only in the weak dephasing limit T2 ≫ t f do we find that the geometric fast-QUAD provides a high-fidelity state transfer. The geometric protocol, due to the minimization of the Landau-Zener transitions, will remain for long times in the anti-crossing region to avoid coherent errors. Thereby, however, it will be most exposed to charge noise.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>FIG. 2.

The geometric protocol, due to the minimization of the Landau-Zener transitions, will remain for long times in the anti-crossing region to avoid coherent errors. Thereby, however, it will be most exposed to charge noise.</figDesc><graphic coords="13,104.81,423.06,406.48,169.37" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Appendix A: Fundamentals of quantum Riemannian geometry a. Bloch sphere from quantum geometry To define the metric g we need to find a basis t µ (x) that spans the tangent space T ρP (H). A natural choice is given by the set of traceless and Hermitian matrices</p><p>where we assume that the density matrices are pure ρ(x) = |ψ(x)⟩⟨ψ(x)| and that the derivative is with respect to the parameters x µ . We can define the quantum geometric tensor as the Killing form on the tangent space T ρP (H)</p><p>We note that the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) has certain symmetries, which, in part, will constrain our dynamics. First, the QGT is invariant under shifts in the ground state energy Ĥ → Ĥ + ω(x) 1, which is the known invariance that only energy differences are measurable and is the expected invariance under U (1). Secondly, the QGT does not change if we rescale the Hamiltonian globally with a function Ω(x), i.e. Ĥ → Ω(x) Ĥ, which we will refer to as conformal invariance. We also need to rescale the time variable to not affect the time dynamics. The conformal invariance will constrain our dynamics to a (dim M -1)-dimensional subspace. To see this, we will work through the example in the main text: A general 2×2 Hamiltonian can be written in the Pauli basis, which in polar coordinates (ρ, ϕ, z) takes the form ĤPauli = z ρ e -iϕ ρ e iϕ -z ,</p><p>where we note that, for pure states, dim P (H Pauli ) = 2 &lt; dim M = 3, as pure states can be fully described by the angles (θ, ϕ) on the Bloch sphere. This condition restricts the notion of M being an embedding of the projective Hilbert space P (H Pauli ) as the map is no longer injective. Due to the conformal invariance, however, we may restrict ourselves to subspaces that span the projective Hilbert space and hence form a well-defined embedding. For instance, if we identify x µ = {ρ, ϕ, z} then we may find a function Ω(x) such that we can reduce the number of parameters. If we want to work in the subspace of x µ = {ρ, z} we find that the quantum metric tensor is singular, i.e. det g = 0, which alludes to the fact that the embedding is ill-defined. This feature can be seen by the fact that there is no non-trivial function Ω(x) that removes the ϕ-dependence. On the other hand, the subsets x µ = {ρ, ϕ} and x µ = {ϕ, z} can be well-defined. For instance, if Ω(x) = z and we redefine ρ/z → ρ, the Pauli Hamiltonian takes the form ĤPauli =</p><p>1 ρ e -iϕ ρ e iϕ -1 , (A5) which leads to a non-singular quantum metric tensor</p></div>
